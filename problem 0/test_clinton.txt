Trump's wall on the border would likely cost at least $25 billion. 

Some things we could do instead: https://t.co/RDbkkyVNB6
We have to build on the Affordable Care Act and continue our march toward making sure every single American has health coverage.
Donald Trump doesn't seem to actually care about making America great so much as he seems to care about making himself look great.
We’re stronger together. When we embrace immigrants, not denigrate them. When we build bridges, not walls.
Donald Trump has spent his career looking to turn a profit, no matter who gets hurt in the process. https://t.co/V9lKg2F44l

In Trump’s world, a “good result” means Trump gets his and working families get hurt. We're better than that.
Trying to profit off of people losing their homes isn't the "kind of thinking our country needs." https://t.co/AQQ6allvIv
We need a president who's fighting to raise incomes for all Americans, not one who tries to profit at their expense. https://t.co/8kwnvVKp9v
Donald Trump could bankrupt America like he bankrupted his companies. Let's make sure he never gets the chance: https://t.co/04t1BHwlVc
Trump prioritizing his own gain over Americans' well-being isn't new, but it is telling: The only person he'll fight for is himself.
This wasn't an anomaly for Trump. His economic plan helps millionaires and hurts middle-class families. He'd let Wall Street run wild again.
How cruel do you have to be to actually root for a crisis that would devastate millions of families, all to pad your own pockets?
Millions of families—disproportionately black and Latino families—lost homes, jobs, and savings.

Trump tried to profit at their expense.
Right before the housing market crashed, @realDonaldTrump said he hoped it would happen—because he could make money off of it.
When Trump got his wish for a housing crash, millions of Americans lost their homes.

This guy can't be president. https://t.co/tnngHNVqoL
