we just won puerto rico! ¡gracias a la isla del encanto por esta victoria!

Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks during church services at Greater St. Paul Church on June 5, 2016 in Oakland, California, two days before the state's presidential primary.Hillary  Clinton is claiming victory the Democratic presidential primary in Puerto Rico, putting her very close to the number of delegates she needs to clinch her party's nomination.The Associated Press reports Clinton led Bernie Sanders by a wide margin in Puerto Rico's vote Sunday. After a blowout victory Saturday in the U.S. Virgin Islands and a decisive lead in Puerto Rico, Clinton is now less than 30 delegates short of the 2,383 needed to win the nomination, according to an AP count."I'm for Hillary, girl," said 83-year-old Candida Dones. "I can't wait for a female president. She's one of us. She wears the pants. If we don't look out for our own interests, who will?"The results were slow to arrive on Sunday, as officials counted ballots by hand and focused first on releasing results tied to the island's local primary elections, said Kenneth McClintock, Puerto Rico's former Democratic National Committeeman.As the results from Puerto Rico trickled in, Clinton maintained a steady 2-to-1 lead over Sanders.Sunday evening, Clinton posted a celebratory tweet about her victory: "We just won Puerto Rico! ¡Gracias a la Isla del Encanto por esta victoria!"We just won Puerto Rico! ¡Gracias a la Isla del Encanto por esta victoria! pic.twitter.com/D2szaqU3fSWhile Puerto Rican residents cannot vote in the general election, the island's politics could reverberate into the fall campaign. Tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans have left the island to escape a dismal economy, with many resettling in the key electoral battleground of Florida.Both Clinton and Sanders spent Sunday campaigning in California, the biggest prize among the five states voting on Tuesday. Clinton told an enthusiastic crowd at Greater St. Paul Baptist Church in Oakland the country is "getting indifferent to the great toll of gun violence," while Sanders made a series of stops in Los Angeles before an evening rally in San Diego."Sorry to disturb your brunch," Sanders said at Hamburger Mary's, taking the microphone during their "drag brunch" as disco lights swirled inside. "I just wanted to say that on Tuesday as you all know there is a very important Democratic primary here in California. And my hope is that everyone will stand up and make clear it is too late for establishment politics."Heading into the last big primary day, California's contest looks like a virtual toss-up. In the latest CBS News Battleground Tracker poll, Hillary Clinton has just a two-point lead over Bernie Sanders, 49 percent to 47 percent, as Sanders has closed a double-digit gap there in recent weeks. In New Jersey -- the other large delegate prize of the night -- Clinton has a solid lead, 61 percent to 34 percent over Sanders.Taken together, Tuesday night is when Clinton is positioned to pick up enough delegates to get the majority she'd need for nomination.While those watching the results in Puerto Rico focused on their impact on the race for the Democratic nomination, the focus of many voters on the island was its ongoing economic crisis.Both Sanders and Clinton had pledged to help as the island's government tries to restructure $70 billion worth of public debt the governor has said is unpayable."This is one of the most important political moments for Puerto Rico," said Emanuel Rosado, a 29-year-old Clinton supporter. "I'm taking action as a result of the economic crisis."Two weeks before the primary, Sanders criticized a rescue deal negotiated by U.S. House leaders and the Obama administration as having colonial overtones. In a letter to fellow Senate Democrats, Sanders said the House bill to create a federal control board and allow some restructuring of the territory's $70 billion debt would make "a terrible situation even worse."He later promised to introduce his own legislation to help the island. Campaigning on the island last month, Sanders promised to fight against "vulture funds" on Wall Street that he said would profit off the fiscal crisis."That bill is anti-democratic and it's not in the best interest of Puerto Rico," said Jorge Gaskins, a 67-year-old farmer who supports Sanders and opposes a control board.Clinton has said she has serious concerns about the board's powers, but believes the legislation should move forward, or "too many Puerto Ricans will continue to suffer."Among those voting Sunday was Democratic Party superdelegate Andres Lopez, one of the party insiders who can vote for the candidate of their choice at the summer convention. He had remained uncommitted, but said Sunday he will support Clinton.Clinton has 1,807 pledged delegates won in primaries and caucuses; Sanders has 1,516. When including superdelegates, her lead over Sanders is substantial - 2,355 to 1,562.With Lopez's endorsement, all seven of Puerto Rico's superdelegates have pledged their support for Clinton."It is time to focus on squashing 'El Trumpo,'" he said, referring to presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
"We're in front of a very hostile judge," the presumptive GOP nominee says

After a Hillary Clinton win in the Puerto Rico Democratic primary, Bernie Sanders has virtually no chance at becoming the Democratic presidential candidate. As reported by CNN, Clinton is closing in on a historic nomination as the first female presidential nominee, and she is now just a few delegates shy of the 2,383 she needs to win the Democratic nomination. As of the time of this report, Clinton has 2,355 delegates while Sanders trails far behind with 1,563.We just won Puerto Rico! ¡Gracias a la Isla del Encanto por esta victoria! pic.twitter.com/D2szaqU3fS— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) June 6, 2016According to Patch, Sanders did not win himself any favors with Democrats in Puerto Rico. On Saturday, his campaign accused local party leaders of fraud, claiming that officials with the campaign were denied access to prisons to help inmates vote.“Our Bernie Sanders officials were never certified. We had 40 officials we submitted in time for the prisons. Not one of them was certified, while all of theirs [Hillary Clinton’s] went in. Attorney Manny Suárez had to go in order for us to be let in. This is a great fraud,” Betsy Franceschini, Hispanic vote director for the campaign, told the publication.As explained in the report, while residents of Puerto Rico — a U.S. territory — participate in the primary, they are not eligible to vote in the November election.¡Puerto Rico! Hoy es tu día de ir a votar por Hillary. Comparte esto y déjale saber a tus amigos: #EstoyConElla. pic.twitter.com/0hjWISk8uR— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) June 5, 2016As said in a report from the Associated Press, the political revolution of Bernie Sanders — and how far he is willing to take his presidential campaign — could depend on the outcome of primaries in California on Tuesday, with Hillary Clinton prepared to secure the Democratic nomination in the coming days. A defeat in California, the most populous state in the country, will significantly weaken his position against Clinton, who has a considerable advantage among superdelegates, the elected leaders, and party officials who formally deposit their votes at the convention.Although it is all but over for the Vermont senator, Sanders is showing no signs of surrender. Sanders will compete in the District of Columbia primaries on June 14, the last of the campaign. Washington, D.C., is expected to have 46 delegates at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. Of this total, 20 will be “pledged delegates.” Historically, the superdelegates have given their support to the candidate who wins the largest number of delegates in primaries and caucuses.“The numbers aren’t going to lie and I think Senator Sanders will recognize the value in seeing his ideas and principles march forward when it’s a one-on-one race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump,” said Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., a top Clinton surrogate.Meanwhile, Clinton has begun to turn her attention to Donald Trump as the November elections loom.The president's job is to take care of our men and women in uniform—while they serve and when they come home. https://t.co/gPhnoWzS63— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) June 5, 2016Most expect Clinton to clench the nomination after voting in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands over the weekend, and California, New Jersey, and four other states on Tuesday. While Clinton is the favorite for the Democratic nomination, Sanders, who calls himself a socialist, has refused to give up. The 74-year-old longtime politician has had great popular support, especially among younger voters, something that has boosted him over the months.Steffen Schmidt, a professor of political science at Iowa State University, said Sanders has no chance to gain the Democratic nomination, and he believes that a lot of those people who have been attracted to the Sanders campaign are not a natural fit with Hillary Clinton. While on the other hand, Douglas E. Schoen, a columnist for the Washington Street Journal, indicates that if Clinton does not win California, it would be a reflection of her weakness and superdelegates could change their minds at the Democratic Convention in July.[Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images]Now Watch This: Trump Accuses Clinton Of Being “Guilty Of Stupidity”Now Read This: Bernie Sanders Would Never Say This But Donald Trump Says ‘Hillary Clinton Has To Go To Jail’All content © 2008

Specifically, they say, Obama has circumvented Congress by issuing a criminal number of executive orders. As many of us already know, Obama has issued an average of 33 orders per year. The last administration to average fewer orders was the first Grover Cleveland White House, circa 1885-1889. But due to the propaganda efforts of Fox News and what David Frum calls “the conservative entertainment complex,” Obama’s orders are indicative of a severe abuse of power and an impeachable trespass against the Constitution. Unlike everyone else who preceded him.The irony here is that most of the bubble-nauts who’ve been attacking Obama for his use of executive orders likely voted for George W. Bush twice and, by proxy, his average of 36 executive orders per year. Today, they intend to further underscore their historical amnesia by voting for circus clown and pathological liar, Donald Trump. Indeed, the most likely criticism we’ll hear in the context of a Trump presidency is “abuse of power.” We’ll also hear the words “executive privilege” and “it’s not illegal if the president does it” tossed around — or in Trump’s childish vernacular, “the best words.”It should be obvious to anyone who’s been paying attention to the election so far. Trump is nothing if not a thin-skinned King Joffrey Lannister who abuses every established path of recourse available to him. For example, the presumptive nominee for the party that’s fought against frivolous lawsuits and in support of tort reform for decades has been involved in more lawsuits than any other presidential candidate in history: 3,500 and counting. He’s been the plaintiff in 1,900 of those suits, including one against Bill Maher because the HBO host and stand-up comic (accurately) compared Trump to an orangutan. It’s difficult to imagine a lawsuit more frivolous than that.While discussing the suit, Maher told Conan O’Brien, “The legal system in this country is not a joke. It’s not a toy for rich idiots to play with. It’s not a collection agency for billionaires.” Unless you’re Trump, of course. (It’s also worth noting that the broader GOP itself has begun to use frivolous lawsuits, due to its legislative impotence, against the Obama White House.)Among Trump’s other lawsuits:They include Trump’s ongoing suit against the town of Palm Beach over airplane noise near his Mar-a-Lago Club and an earlier lawsuit against the town over an 80-foot flag pole. Trump’s team argued in court that a smaller flag would understate his patriotism, but he eventually settled with town officials, agreeing among other concessions to lower the pole by 10 feet.But Trump’s fetish for frivolous lawsuits isn’t necessarily the primary source of danger in his would-be presidency.Not too long ago, one of Trump’s psychotic yappy-dogs, Roger Stone, who, by the way, has accused Hillary Clinton of engaging in a “war on women,” amplifying the meme into a book-length screed, told Breitbart News Daily that Trump will strip CNN of its FCC license when elected. Stone said, “When Donald Trump is president, he should turn off their FCC license. They’re not a news organization; they’re about censorship.” And by “censorship,” Stone was referring to the fact that CNN banned him for making demonstrably false statements. Regardless, the threat alone could have a dangerously chilling effect on political journalism during a Trump presidency, rewinding the calendar to the Nixon era when the White House exploited the office to settle political scores of all varieties.On Friday, meanwhile, Trump told a rally crowd in San Jose that he’d order his attorney general to investigate and indict Hillary Clinton.“You know what, if they do let her get away with it, it will be a big topic of conversation on the campaign trail. I can tell you that, folks. Then if I win, it’s called a five-year statute of limitations. If I win, everything is going to be fair, but I’m sure the Attorney General will take a very good look at it from a fair stand point, okay.”When was the last time anyone described Trump as “fair?” I mean, other than Trump himself.Of course, Trump’s threat was issued the day after Hillary Clinton emasculated him for 45 consecutive minutes during which the forthcoming Democratic nominee referred to Trump as “unprepared” and “temperamentally unfit to hold an office.” Hillary also presented the script for what could turn out to be a scathing “Daisy” style campaign video:“Now imagine Donald Trump sitting in the Situation Room making life or death decisions on behalf of the United States. Imagine him deciding whether to send your spouses or children into battle. Imagine if he not just had his Twitter account at his disposal when he’s angry, but America’s entire arsenal. Do we want him making those calls? Someone thin-skinned, and quick to anger who lashes out at the smallest criticism. Do we want his finger anywhere near The Button?”While we’re here, it’s impossible to not think about a Trump tweet from 2013 in which he suggested that women in the military are asking to be raped simply because they enlisted — a misogynistic insult that also indicted male members of the armed forces who, apparently, are all rapists.Nevertheless, as brutal as she was, notice how she never once threatened to sue or to investigate Trump, who surely deserves whatever comeuppance that drops into his pathetically minuscule lap.What we’re witnessing here are super-colossal red flags. Trump will absolutely seize every opportunity to legally or extra-legally punish his political enemies, namely a long list of Democrats and, with them, a longer list of journalists, possibly beginning with Univision’s Jorge Ramos and, as Roger Stone hinted, the entire CNN organization. Given how he’s floated the idea of nominating Benghazi witch-hunter Trey Gowdy as attorney general, it wouldn’t be surprising. We can also expect that if his attorney general fails to abide and pursue Trump’s dictatorial mandates, Trump will merely pull a Nixon-style “Saturday Night Massacre,” in which he simply fires and replaces one attorney general after another until he lands on one that’ll do his bidding.And then, both Democrats and Republicans will long for the days of Barack Obama and, yes, George W. Bush.Brandon, 28, "Hipster"This self-proclaimed "hipster" by trade — that's right, not an artisanal chocolatier or re-claimed wood whittler but a generic "hipster" — doesn't even have any tattoos.

Hillary Clinton defeated her rival Bernie Sanders in Puerto Rico’s Democratic primary on Sunday, bringing her to the brink of victory in their long-fought battle for the party’s presidential nomination.Former secretary of state Clinton won with 59.38% of the vote against 37.53% for Sanders, according to official results from the Democratic Party of Puerto Rico.Victory in debt-hobbled Puerto Rico marked a double dose of good news for Clinton over the weekend, with another territory, the US Virgin Islands, voting overwhelmingly for her on Saturday.The pair of wins provides a boost ahead of Tuesday’s culminating vote with New Jersey and the big prize of California at stake.¡Puerto Rico! Hoy es tu día de ir a votar por Hillary. Comparte esto y déjale saber a tus amigos: #EstoyConElla. pic.twitter.com/0hjWISk8uR“We just won Puerto Rico! ¡Gracias a la Isla del Encanto por esta victoria!” -- Clinton wrote in a bilingual tweet that thanked the Isle of Enchantment for the win.Puerto Rico has 60 pledged delegates at stake, and Clinton won 36 of them, with 24 going to Sanders.That puts Clinton, who amassed 2,323 delegates prior to Puerto Rico’s vote, just a handful shy of the 2,383 needed to clinch the Democratic nomination, a threshold she will undoubtedly cross on Tuesday.Sanders, however, has vowed to fight on all the way until the Democratic National Convention in July, arguing he could persuade many of the several hundred so-called super delegates who back Clinton to change their allegiance and support his campaign.Super delegates are Democratic Party bigwigs who are not bound to any candidate or to the results of statewide votes and do not officially cast their vote until the convention.Both Clinton and Sanders campaigned in Puerto Rico in recent weeks, and both have put forward plans to help the island emerge from a debt crisis.Lawmakers have introduced legislation, backed by the White House, that would be charged with overseeing fiscal and structural reforms aimed at stabilizing its finances and restructuring the Caribbean island’s $70 billion in debt.

http://www.laopinion.com/2016/01/14/puede-alguien-nacido-en-canada-ser-presidente-de-estados-unidos/

Lunes 06 de Junio 2016“Tristemente, no hay manera de que Ted Cruz pueda seguir compitiendo en las primarias del Partido Republicano a no ser que borre las dudas sobre su elegibilidad. ¡Los demócratas lo llevarían a los tribunales!”.Eso escribió este miércoles Donald Trump en Twitter respecto a su más directo rival en la carrera por la candidatura republicana a la Casa Blanca.Las dudas que menciona son, en realidad, las que él mismo ha venido sembrando esta semana, porque el senador Cruz nació en Canadá.La Constitución de EE.UU. exige para ser presidente ser “ciudadano natural por nacimiento” (natural born citizen, en inglés), pero no detalla exactamente qué significa.“¿Significa “ciudadano natural por nacimiento” haber nacido en territorio de EE.UU.? Realmente no lo sé. Pero en ese caso, él no lo es”, dijo Trump en una reciente entrevista con la cadena Fox.El asunto de la elegibilidad de Cruz ha vuelto a ocupar titulares por la insistencia de Trump.Cruz, de padre cubano y madre estadounidense de sangre italiana e irlandesa, asegura que pese a que nació en Calgary, es ciudadano estadounidense de nacimiento porque heredó esa condición de su madre.El domingo, en un programa de CNN, Cruz insistió: “Como una cuestión legal, la Constitución y las leyes federales son claras al señalar que el hijo de un ciudadano estadounidense que nace en el exterior es un ciudano natural”, dijo el candidato.El debate parecía aplacado pero según Cruz, ha vuelto a la agenda en tanto todos lo atacan por el hecho de que aparezca liderando las encuestas de cara a la primera contienda en las primarias, el caucus de Iowa el próximo 1 de febrero.Cruz vive desde los cuatro años en EEUU, es abogado graduado en Harvard, senador desde 2012 y una figura prominente del Partido Republicano que ha llamado la atención por su retórica bombástica y sus fuertes críticas al presidente Barack Obama.El debate sobre el origen de Rafael Edward “Ted” Cruz surgió en agosto de 2013, cuando el Dallas Morning News informó que su nacimiento en el extranjero podría suponer un problema en una futura aspiración presidencial.El senador, para evitar un debate mayor, ofreció su partida de nacimiento y luego aclaró que es un ciudadano nato de EEUU porque su madre nació en este país.“Cuando era niño –dijo– mi madre me dijo que podía decidir si quería la nacionalidad canadiense. Obtuve mi pasaporte estadounidense en el colegio”.El senador, que aparece como uno de los favoritos a ser el candidato republicano para las elecciones presidenciales de 2016, enfatizó en su momento que nunca había solicitado el pasaporte canadiense.En 2014, para que no quedara lugar a dudas acerca de si tenía doble nacionalidad, hizo oficial su renuncia a la nacionalidad canadiense: él se considera sólo estadounidense.¿Qué significa exactamente ser ciudadano natural por nacimiento? “No hay una interpretación legal definitiva”, le dijo a BBC Mundo Sarah Duggin, profesora de derecho de la Universidad Católica de EEUU.Sin embargo, la interpretación legal dominante es que una persona obtiene su nacionalidad al nacer, ya sea porque llegó al mundo en territorio estadounidense o porque tiene un padre o madre estadounidense.Esto efectivamente evitaría que un inmigrante nacionalizado llegara a la Casa Blanca, aunque no pondría trabas a las aspiraciones de Cruz.El tema, con claros matices en cada caso, ha reaparecido en diferentes momentos: se habló de ello, por ejemplo, cuando John McCain –que nació en una base militar de EEUU en el Canal de Panamá– ganó la nominación republicana a presidente en 2008.El caso quedó resuelto cuando el Senado aprobó una resolución declarándolo ciudadano natural.A finales de 2011, el Servicio de Investigaciones del Congreso (CRS, por sus siglas en inglés) preparó un informe para los congresistas sobre el tema, en el que resalta precisamente las dudas e interpretaciones que ha habido sobre el concepto.Cuando surgió la discusión respecto al caso de Cruz en 2013, BBC Mundo le consultó sobre el asunto a Randy Barnett, profesor de Teoría Legal de la Universidad de Georgetown (EEUU).“Estas son preguntas que están siendo presentadas por partidarios políticos contra quienes se estén oponiendo”, dijo Barnett. “Son críticas motivadas políticamente”.También se habló de la necesidad entonces de reformular el texto de la Constitución para que no haya lugar a dudas. Sarah Duggin, por ejemplo, escribió un documento en 2005 recomendando esa medida, aunque admite que sería un proceso difícil.Duggin explica que las razones originales por las que la Constitución incluyó esa cláusula no aplican en los tiempos actuales.A finales del siglo XVIII, según argumentan Duggin y Barnett, la preocupación de quienes escribieron ese documento clave era evitar que un ciudadano europeo pudiera ser declarado elegible para asumir la presidencia de EE.UU.Pero en la actualidad, en opinión de Duggin, “esto no es una representación de la lealtad”. “Hay muchas personas que son ciudadanas leales, pero no nacieron en suelo estadounidense”.Por eso, al concluir la conversación con BBC Mundo, ella cree que es importante discutir este tema.“Es algo que necesita atención nacional porque va a volver a aparecer en el futuro”.___*Esta nota fue actualizada a partir del original, publicado en agosto de 2013.#VotaLatino2016#VotaLatino2016 Hillary Clinton 3 horas hace Trump's bigoted comments about a Latino judge are so disgusting, even other Republicans are offended. ...

                        If Sanders wins the biggest and most delegate-rich primary, all bets are off.
            By Gabriel Debenedetti06/06/16 05:12 AM EDTLOS ANGELES — Barring a set of unprecedented upsets on Tuesday, Hillary Clinton is expected to be declared the presumptive Democratic nominee. And when the television networks make that call as soon as New Jersey polls close on June 7, it will leave Bernie Sanders with a hard choice: whether to directly acknowledge it or intensify his fight to the July convention in Philadelphia.The Vermont senator has shown few signs of being ready to concede. And if he wins California, he won't.Story Continued BelowThe outcome there will determine the course he takes in the seven-week runup to the convention, top Sanders aides and high-profile supporters say, either driving his decision to battle on for the nomination or to begin focusing on the party policy and platform changes he wants to make.A win in California, his top advisers believe, will enable Sanders to make a much more aggressive pitch to superdelegates and Democrats around the country in the coming weeks. He will be able to point to victories over Clinton in more than 20 states — capped by the biggest, bluest and most diverse in the nation. The symbolic value of winning California, they think, would underscore his point that the future of the party is on his side and rattle superdelegate confidence in her candidacy. A loss, however, would dismantle that argument. The Sanders camp believes a defeat there would take the wind out of his sails, in no small part because of the negative media narrative that would result after having spent so much time in the state.Sanders hasn’t directly addressed the issue of how he’ll respond Tuesday evening, though it’s clearly something that’s on his mind. He has shown no outward sign of bowing to the increasingly loud grumblings from Clinton-allied officials — most recently Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid — urging him to drop out after California, and he brushes aside the suggestion that his prolonged primary challenge could hurt Clinton against Donald Trump.
2016
            By Louis Nelson“On Tuesday night, on the 7th, you’re going to hear from the media saying that Hillary Clinton has received whatever it is — 80 or 90 delegates — which she certainly will from New Jersey and other states, and they’ll say the primary process is over, Secretary Clinton has won,” Sanders told a crowd in Santa Cruz last week. “The Democratic National Committee will tell you it’s not factually correct. The truth is no candidate — not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders — will receive the number of pledged delegates, that is, the real delegates that people vote for. Neither candidate will have received the number of pledged delegates that he or she needs to become the Democratic nominee. What that means is that the superdelegates will be the people who determine who the nominee is.”“The media is in error when they lumped superdelegates with pledged delegates. Pledged delegates are real,” he reiterated in a combative news conference in Los Angeles on Saturday. “The Democratic National Convention will be a contested convention.”Sanders has promised to give every voter a chance to weigh in, meaning he will compete in Washington, D.C.’s June 14 primary — for which his campaign has recently sought volunteer housing.But even within Sanders circles, there is considerable head-scratching and puzzling through back-of-the-envelope delegate math in an attempt to figure out what the senator will do next.Some aides near the top rungs of his political operation report being told to focus exclusively on Tuesday’s primaries, and not to worry about what comes next.“Basically, he decides daily. What decides what happens after Tuesday is going to depend on what the results are,” said Dottie Deans, chairwoman of the Vermont Democratic Party and a superdelegate who supports Sanders. “They’ll sit down Wednesday and they’ll discuss what happened on Tuesday and decide how to go forward."“I will accept any decision he makes, and I will respect any decision he makes,” she added. “But I’m not in any position to tell him what to do. Nor would he listen to me.”One consensus expectation is that the Sanders campaign team will seek to leverage the senator’s all-but-ensured status as the most successful runner-up in modern Democratic politics.

Or he could effectively concede the nomination and prepare his troops for platform fights and a contentious convention in Philadelphia.Sanders has a wide array of options as he pursues his stated goal of persuading super delegates — whose very existence he decries — to switch their support from Clinton to him. He could, for example, hold swing state rallies to make the case against nominating Clinton, an approach that might let him maintain the earned media that sustains his public image.But that tack is unlikely. He hasn’t unleashed a new argument against Clinton in weeks, indicating a diminished appetite for that kind of combat, and a purple-state assault could weaken her against Trump. In addition, people close to the campaign expect the operation to severely cut back on travel after he’s spent over two weeks straight in California, largely because of the expense. The campaign has already been drastically slashing costs, and the staff is now down nearly to the group of senior advisers and an advance staff that’s necessary for large events.A lower-profile, but cheaper avenue to pursue might be to meet individually with as many super delegates as possible in an effort to swing them. But more and more of these party leaders and officials have spoken up about how difficult that would be after he’s denounced the superdelegate system in the first place, and prominent Sanders backers say they don’t view this alone as a practical option. It would likely take something more drastic to win over the superdelegates: none of those who support Clinton have been persuaded to swing to Sanders’ side in the year-plus of campaigning so far.One option floated by some Democrats — but not a popular one among Sanders’ most ardent backers — is that he could concede that Clinton is the nominee but encourage his army of delegates to fight for specific platform points and rules changes at the July convention. This might be the most realistic conciliatory route, said some party officials thinking through the options, noting that it’s similar to the approach taken by Ted Cruz, who maintained until the final days of his campaign that he’d fight on to the GOP convention. But the Vermont senator has repeatedly insisted that he will take his leverage to Philadelphia, and his senior advisers have not seriously thought through how that would look without him as an active candidate.Not expecting a concession of any sort, Sanders’ allies universally expect a major part of his role in the coming weeks will be to outline his convention hopes to his delegates.“I think what he’s going to do is provide a lot of direction about what happens at the [convention], assuming the [Democratic National Committee] is not going to embrace our agenda. But we are going to be in a position to at least have a minority report and vote to put our issues on the agenda,” said RoseAnn DeMoro, the executive director of the Sanders-backing National Nurses United union, who referred to Tuesday’s expected declaration of Clinton as the nominee as a “big lie.” “The pivot, I don’t know. It depends on how corrupt the DNC actually is once we get to Philadelphia,” she said. “That could determine the direction that takes.”In addition to the policy points that Sanders is expected to push before the convention — a $15 federal minimum wage and a nationwide ban on fracking, for example — he is also eyeing fundamental reforms to the Democratic nominating process, which would have to be made separately from the convention.The Clinton camp has been extremely careful not to be seen as urging Sanders to get out of the race, keeping in mind her own 2008 campaign against then-Sen. Barack Obama, which went until the very end. Asked whether Sanders should drop out next week while campaigning in New Jersey last Wednesday, former President Bill Clinton declined to weigh in. “We should finish the course. Finish the election,” he said.Nonetheless, some of Sanders’ high-profile backers have been quietly nudging him toward the exit in the name of party unity, starting with Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, his only Senate endorser, who said in April that he should drop out if he’s still trailing Clinton after the primaries end.And as party leaders start openly fretting about uniting the party against Trump, the drumbeat has picked up: “Sometimes you just have to give up,” Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid told The Associated Press on Wednesday. “I’ve never been too good at math, but I can figure that one out, I think he better do a little mathing.”

            By Diana D’AbruzzoEven Sanders’ backers are reluctant to publicly offer advice at this point. Not one of the eight House members endorsing Sanders agreed to speak with POLITICO on record about what he should do.Yet some vague outlines of Sanders’ coming month-and-a-half are already coming into view, with or without his say. Some of his highest-profile backers — including the nurses union, 350.org, the Democratic Socialists of America and the Working Families Party — are convening a June 17-19 meeting in Chicago “to, in part, continue the momentum and movement building associated with the ongoing Bernie Sanders campaign."The event, which is set to include workshops on civil disobedience and building movements, is slated to focus on a slate of issues his campaign team wants to pursue for the convention platform, like the minimum wage hike and a Wall Street speculation tax. Sanders himself has been invited to join the roster of speakers that includes a who’s who of his most prominent surrogates including Cornel West, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Arizona Rep. Raúl Grijalva and DeMoro.The goal: to map out what’s still to come.“His candidacy and his potential presidency is about a movement,” said DeMoro of Sanders. “We had a similar movement, though not of the same magnitude, behind Obama. But as soon as he entered office, the movement went away.”

Saturday was a big day for second-place candidates in the presidential race, as Ted Cruz grabbed morale-boosting wins in caucuses Kansas and Maine while Bernie Sanders saw victories in Kansas and Nebraska.Their gains were, however, countered by victories for Hillary Clinton, in the Democratic Louisiana primary, and Donald Trump in Louisiana and a Republican caucus in Kentucky.Here are nine things we learned from the day’s events.Sign in

FRESNO, Calif. — Hillary Clinton’s savage takedown of Donald Trump in her recent foreign-policy speech has her supporters fired up.As the likely Democratic nominee toured California on Saturday, crowds burst into applause at the mere mention of Thursday’s speech, in which Clinton cast Trump as dangerously unqualified to be president. Supporters say they feel more confident and excited in the wake of the address — which could benefit Clinton, who has struggled to inspire enthusiasm throughout the primary contest.We have used your information to see if you have a subscription with us.

I was waiting for that,” said Leslie Milke, 56, of Woodland Hills, a professor at Los Angeles Mission College, who saw Clinton. “I knew she was capable of that kind of speech....It really made me feel energized. It made me feel like we can win.”Clinton’s speech in San Diego previewed her intention to mount an aggressive campaign against the real estate mogul. In it, she said Trump would lead the nation toward war and economic crisis, contrasting it with her long years of diplomatic experience and public service. Looking to the November general election, Clinton, who is expected to clinch the Democratic nomination in the coming days, said electing Trump would be a “historic mistake.”Since then Clinton has only increased the heat.“I think it is time to judge Donald Trump by his words and his deeds. I think his words and his deeds disqualify him from being president,” Clinton said in Oxnard, Calif., on Saturday. She later mockingly cited some of Trump’s past remarks, saying: “One of my personal favorites is he said he knows how to deal with Putin because he took the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow.”Later in the day, a raucous crowd of more than 1,400 in Fresno started chanting “Hillary, Hillary,” when Clinton mentioned her speech.“Donald Trump is not qualified or temperamentally fit to be president of the United States,” Clinton said amid applause.As she shifted her focus almost entirely to the presumptive Republican nominee, her rival Bernie Sanders continued his quest for the Democratic nomination, declaring Saturday that Clinton will not have enough pledged delegates after Tuesday’s contests, and the Democrats are headed toward a contested summer convention.Still, Clinton supporters like Walter Guzman, 44, of Oxnard, said it was time for her to turn to Trump, saying “she needs to stop concentrating on Bernie and start concentrating on Trump.”Of course, engaging with Trump — who has shown little restraint with negative campaigning and is skilled at sucking up media attention — has its risks. Many of Trump’s GOP primary opponents sought to take him on unsuccessfully, most notably Sen. Marco Rubio, whose Trump attacks were viewed as out of keeping with his inspirational message.Sandy Emberland, 72, of Thousand Oaks, said she knew the race was “going to be dirty and bad,” but said “I think she will stay above the fray.”Meanwhile, Sonia Prince, 60, of North Oxnard, said that while she is confident Clinton can fight fire with fire, she’d prefer not to hear about Trump at all.“Because bad publicity or good publicity, it’s publicity for him,” she said.© 2016 The Associated Press.

Media Attention

you two bozo's can make all the stupid comments you wantcorrupt hillary goons are the only ones getting arrested for assault on Trump supporters and police officers,corrupt hillary goons are the ones getting arrested for vandalism and arson corrupt hillary is encouraging her goons to riot at Mr Trump rallies Hillary lives in a glass house.  This will be a mistake for her to be casting rocks.  Hillary speaking of ethics is absurd.  She's crooked Hillary.Naive Charles. Who benefits with undecided voters from these violent acts? Usually the one who benefits is the one paying the violent instigators to instigate with violence. Who would that be? Hmmm Naive Charles, It is an old political trick to have a supporter puncture your tires or throw a brick through you headquarters window and point the finger at your opponent. And remember we are dealing with a guy whose fraudulent "University" was tossed out of Texas by non other than the most conservative Governor then AG for fraudulent behavior. So Trump is capable of most any kind of despicable act. Dishonest Donald is who has encouraged violence at his rallies Professor Craighead.  It is just another stark example of why the GOP primary voters have made a terrible mistake in nominating Dishonest Donald.corrupt hillary is instigating violence towards Mr Trump and his supporters.  Even more telling is how many Republicans have risen to support their presumptive nominee against Ms. Clinton's attack.We're always interested in hearing about news in our community.

donald trump’s not just wrong about judge curiel—he’s wrong about america. he’s wrong about what makes this country great.

http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-muslim-judge-2016-6

CBSDonald Trump on "Face The Nation"Last week, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee suggested that Indiana-born Judge Gonzalo Curiel - whose parents are Mexican - should not preside over fraud lawsuits against Trump University, a for-profit university formerly owned by Trump. In a Sunday interview on "Face The Nation," Trump also suggested a Muslim judge would not be able to hear a case against him because of Trump's plan to bar Muslims from entering the US."If it were a Muslim judge, do you also feel that they wouldn't be able to treat you fairly because of that policy of yours?" host John Dickerson asked."It's possible, yes," Trump replied. "That would be possible, absolutely."Dickerson pushed Trump, asking whether the real-estate magnate was unfairly discrediting judges because of their ethnic background. "Isn't there sort of a tradition though in America that we don't judge people by who their parents were and where they came from?" Dickerson asked."I'm not talking about tradition - I'm talking about common sense," Trump said.Trump's assertion that Curiel is not qualified to fairly hear Trump's case because of the judge's parents' nationality has ignited a firestorm of criticism from the real-estate mogul's political opponents.In a Saturday speech in California, Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton slammed Trump's "prejudiced, bigoted attack" on Curiel."This is not just another outlandish, insulting comment from Donald Trump, and it is not normal politics. This is something much, much more dangerous," Clinton said.She continued: "Judge Curiel is as much of an American as I am, and he's as much of an American as Donald Trump is. But he has Mexican roots. So to Donald Trump, that means he can't do his job. Well, Donald Trump's not just wrong about Judge Curiel, he's wrong about America. He's wrong about what makes this country great."Would a Muslim judge also be out of the question here? @realdonaldtrump: "...It's possible, yes."https://t.co/49qUfRCrLV- Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) June 5, 2016Would a Muslim judge also be out of the question here? @realdonaldtrump: "...It's possible, yes."https://t.co/49qUfRCrLVSamsung Mobile|Micromax Mobile|Sony Mobile|Asus Mobile|Motorola Mobile|Xiaomi MobileAbout | Business Insider Global |  Advertising |  Authors |  Write for Us |  RSS |  Terms |  Privacy PolicyTimes Global Partners is an initiative focused on partnering with Established and Emerging Global Digital Companies for growing their presence and business in India through growth in their Brand, audience, adoption, distribution and monetization.Copyright @ 2016.

+65 6212 1000Presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump addresses a campaign rally on May 25, 2016, in Anaheim, California.Donald Trump broadened his assertion that a Mexican-American judge is too biased to preside over a fraud lawsuit against his defunct real estate school, saying that a hypothetical Muslim judge may be similarly disqualified.The Republican Party’s presumptive presidential nominee has criticized San Diego federal court judge Gonzalo Curiel for handing down rulings in the case against Trump University that Trump considers unfair. Trump has said Curiel’s rulings are retribution for the candidate’s pledge to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border if elected in November.QuickTake Electing a U.S. PresidentPolitical allies have distanced themselves from those remarks while adversaries have called them racist.“What if it was a Muslim judge?” John Dickerson, the host of CBS News’ "Face the Nation," asked Trump on Sunday. Trump has proposed a temporary ban of all Muslim immigration into the U.S. because of war and instability in the Middle East and the potential for terrorist attacks.“Would you also feel like they wouldn’t be able to treat you fairly because of that policy of yours?” Dickerson asked.“That would be possible, absolutely,” Trump answered.When pressed about a U.S. tradition of not judging people by their heritage or nationality, Trump told Dickerson: “I’m not talking about tradition, I’m talking about common sense, OK?”In a separate pre-recorded interview, also televised on Sunday, Trump told CNN news anchor Jake Tapper that Curiel had been unfair.“But he’s an American,” Tapper said of the Indiana-born jurist. “If you’re saying he cannot do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism?” “No, he’s proud of his heritage,” Trump said. “We’re building a wall. He’s a Mexican.”Trump’s suggestions of judicial bias have drawn criticism from legal scholars and from Republicans including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Both Ryan and McConnell have endorsed Trump for president.Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who’s been discussed as a possible running mate for Trump, said on “Fox News Sunday” that Trump’s criticism of Curiel’s heritage was “inexcusable.” Democratic Presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton said on Saturday that “Judge Curiel is as much of an American as I am. And he’s as much of an American as Donald Trump is.”The interviews were broadcast three days after Clinton called Trump temperamentally unfit and too unstable to be entrusted with the presidency.“You can’t have that success without good temperament,” the Republican told Tapper, citing his success in real estate development, television -- where he starred in NBC’s “The Apprentice” -- and now politics. “I have a temperament that is totally under control.”Tapper asked the candidate about prior statements that seemed to support a nuclear-armed Japan as a deterrent to potential North Korean or Chinese aggression.Trump said that while the U.S. is bound to defend Japan in the event of an attack, the reverse isn’t true.“That’s where the nukes come in,” Tapper prompted. “That’s up to them,” Trump replied, adding that the U.S. had to be prepared to walk away from agreements that are costing it billions of dollars. Reminded that he was talking about major U.S. allies, Trump said, “it has to work both ways.”American allies including Japan, Germany and Saudi Arabia should be compelled to pay in full for American military protection, Trump said.“We’re providing a tremendous service,” Trump told Tapper, adding the U.S. -- the world’s largest economy -- “is stone-cold broke.”The billionaire’s demands to renegotiate alliances threaten to up-end decades of U.S. military and diplomatic strategy. While the U.S. spends billions of dollars basing troops and equipment overseas, that has historically been part of a trade-off that allows American power to be projected abroad.

After months of underhanded attacks on Judge Gonzalo Curiel, the federal judge presiding over two class-action suits against Trump University, Donald Trump finally came out and said it: people with "Mexican heritage" can't be trusted to put American values first.Here's what he told the Wall Street Journal on Thursday:Mr. Trump said U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel had "an absolute conflict" in presiding over the litigation given that he was "of Mexican heritage" and a member of a Latino lawyers’ association. Mr. Trump said the background of the judge, who was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrants, was relevant because of his campaign stance against illegal immigration and his pledge to seal the southern U.S. border. "I’m building a wall. It’s an inherent conflict of interest," Mr. Trump said.Repeatedly and over months, Trump and his campaign have insinuated that Curiel is hostile toward Trump and everything he represents because he's Hispanic and proud of it. And now, Trump is doing us all the favor of stating it outright.Donald Trump doesn't say outright that there are "good" and "bad" Hispanics in America. He doesn't have to. When in one breath he says "I love the Hispanics" and "the Hispanics will vote for me" and in the next he says that someone with "Mexican heritage" can't be objective in judging a case against him because they oppose his building a wall, his supporters can fill in the blanks.This isn't the first time the Trump campaign has implied that people who aren't white men are incapable of being objective: Campaign chair Paul Manafort all but ruled out the idea of nominating a nonwhite or nonmale vice president because it would "be seen as pandering." But what Trump is doing now is more sinister: He's implying that taking pride in one's ethnicity — to the extent of, say, being a member of an ethnic association — indicates that you're not proud of being an American. He's nonchalantly calling, by extension, the patriotism of millions of nonwhite Americans into question.By any objective measure, Gonzalo Curiel ought to be the kind of Hispanic whom Donald Trump likes a lot. He spent years as an assistant US attorney in San Diego, prosecuting people for smuggling drugs over the border. He's literally gotten death threats from a member of a Mexican cartel. Judge Curiel has done more to secure the border over his career than Trump ever has.But Curiel refused to dismiss the class-action lawsuits against Trump University, even though Donald Trump thought he should. That makes him suspect. And because he's insufficiently supportive of Trump, it stands to reason that he must be the wrong kind of Hispanic — the kind who doesn't care about the border."I think it has to do perhaps with the fact that I'm very, very strong on the border, very, very strong at the border, and he has been extremely hostile to me," Trump told Fox News in February. That's the line he picked up in June to the Journal: that Curiel's heritage is a "conflict of interest," because his family is from Mexico and Trump wants to build a wall there.Trump likes to say that if you don't have a border, you don't have a country. So if you are hostile to someone because he's strong on the border, what does that say about your feelings toward America?There are two actual pieces of evidence that Trump or Trump spokespeople have advanced to demonstrate Curiel's supposed bias. One is that he was appointed by President Barack Obama — something that is true of 320 of America's 860 authorized judges. The other is that he is a member of the La Raza Lawyers Association.The La Raza Lawyers Association is a group of California Latinos in law trying to support and advance other Latinos in law. It's a pretty basic concept for a professional organization. It's only suspect if you think that any organization for a particular ethnic group is divisive, or (as members of the alt-right believe) that they're fighting for power and dominance in society and white people need to fight back.In the eyes of the Trump campaign (or at least of spokesperson Katrina Pierson), though, the lawyers association is a radical group: "an organization that has been out there organizing anti-Trump protesters with the Mexican flags." 




 
Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times

These girls are members of a dance group with "La Raza" in the name — does that make them un-American, too?There is literally no evidence of anything like this. As best as I can figure, what's happening is that Pierson got confused by the phrase "La Raza"1 — which many racial conservatives use to stand in for the kind of radical Latino groups that are interested, they believe, in advancing their own ethnic interests at the expense of everyone else's.The National Council on La Raza, a fairly establishment, DC-based Latino interest group, is often characterized in conservative circles as the face of Latino radicalism (probably because of the "La Raza" — "the race" — in the name). Trump protesters are assumed to be "radical" Hispanics, so they must be with "La Raza"; Judge Curiel is a member of a group with "La Raza" in the name, so he must be one of them.In other words, this is the strongest actual argument that Curiel is biased against Donald Trump in a way that the other 37 percent of the federal bench appointed by Obama are not: that because he is a member of an organization that takes pride in Latino ethnicity, he is more interested in Latino interests than American ones. The only good Hispanic, in other words, is one who doesn't make too much noise about it.Trump has been criticized for the "Mexican" thing because it's easy to pick on: It's verifiably wrong; people tend to understand that, on some level, it's being heard as a slur; and talking about people using "bad words" is often the easiest way to talk about racism. But it's a trap. At worst, it ends up clearing a path for people to express racist attitudes without getting criticized.Focus on calling Judge Curiel "Mexican," and maybe — maybe — Donald Trump will stop doing it. (This is Trump, so it's arguably more likely that he'll call such cries PC culture and start doing it more often just to troll.) Even if you focus more broadly on the inappropriateness of Trump attacking a sitting federal judge for bias and calling for him to be investigated, you might, in a best-case scenario, get Trump to shut up about Curiel until the election.But Gonzalo Curiel is not the only prominent person in America who's a member of an ethnic organization. If you think that being "strong on the border" and being a member of an organization with "La Raza" in the name are mutually exclusive, there are a lot of prominent Latinos whose loyalty to America comes under suspicion. And in a climate of rising Islamophobia where the Council on American-Islamic Relations is under suspicion in some circles as a terrorist fifth column, just think about what this says about the loyalty of Muslims.And conversely, if you think that being a proud Latino isn't mutually exclusive with being a proud American, that's the principle you need to defend.

lying about veterans, his business, and his own words—and that wasn't even the worst thing trump said this week.

http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/6/5/1533493/-So-Trump-fans-say-they-want-a-businessman-as-President

From the beginning of his unlikely quest for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, Donald Trump has enjoyed the strong backing of those GOP voters who say they want a successful businessman in the White House. After only his outsider status, Gallup polling showed earlier this year, backers of the real estate mogul turned reality TV star cited his record as a "good businessman" as the leading factor driving their support. A staggering 64 percent of those surveyed said Trump would be the best Republican candidate on the economy and jobs; 61 percent claimed he would best handle the federal budget deficit.Anecdotes from the campaign trail support those numbers. While casino magnate and Republican sugar daddy Sheldon Adelson jumped on the bandwagon by explaining, "Trump is a businessman; I am a businessman," one GOP acolyte boasted "ONLY TRUMP has ever BUILT any REAL THINGS." Another showed he had completely drunk the Kool-Aid:But a recent survey of Fortune 500 CEO's found that the leaders of America's largest companies surprisingly prefer Democrat Hillary Clinton over The Donald by a 58 to 42 percent margin. Of course, it's not just Trump's incendiary statements on trade, immigration and "other comments showing his lack of understanding of the basics of government" that are so frightening. As it turns out, the historical record of our businessmen-presidents is a dismal one. The miserable math and hilariously horrible policies of the would-be next CEO President would virtually guarantee an even worse economic performance than America's last one. Worst of all, a growing mountain of evidence shows that pretend populist Donald Trump isn't a paragon of business, but instead a profit-seeking parasite deceptively extracting money from the taxpayers and hard-working Americans he claims he would represent as president of the United States.Four years ago, David J. Lynch of Bloomberg News warned Mitt Romney that touting his Bain Capital credentials might not end well for him. History, Lynch pointed out, was not on his side:George W. Bush was the first president with a master's in business administration. His father, George H.W. Bush, made a fortune in oil before entering politics. In their pre-Oval Office days, Jimmy Carter ran a peanut farm and warehouse and Hoover was a wealthy mining executive and financier.Of that group, only George W. Bush was re-elected.Like Trump, Dubya bragged about his business experience, boasting during his White House run that "I understand what can happen in the marketplace." Ultimately, however, America's First MBA President presided over what the Washington Post rightly called the "Weakest Economy in Decades." While the New York Times offered a devastating collection of charts documenting the Businessman Bush's carnage, the Wall Street Journal summed up "Bush on Jobs: The Worst Track Record On Record." If anything, these early 2009 post-mortems grossly understated the cataclysmic failure of the man with the Masters in Business Administration from Harvard B-School. As it turned out, the recession that began in December 2007 was far worse than anyone knew at the time:All in all, private sector employment shrank during the Bush years. At the same time, the national debt nearly doubled under George W. Bush, thanks in part to his massive tax cuts for the wealthy. (It's no wonder most economists laughed when Jeb Bush promised to average four percent economic growth over his time in the White House; no president named Bush had ever hit that figure even once in 12 years.)Sadly, for Donald Trump and his fans all the boasting about his wealth and deal-making prowess runs into another historical obstacle: the U.S. economy almost always does better under Democratic presidents. It's not even close. Going back to Herbert Hoover, the economy grew faster, job creation accelerated, incomes expanded and stock prices jumped higher when a Democrat sat in the Oval Office. And as the New Democrat Network documented last fall, the last four presidencies are no exception to the rule:Even leaving aside for the moment today's low energy prices and the dramatic reduction in the ranks of the uninsured thanks to the Affordable Care Act, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama literally beat the Bushes:As I noted in January, President Obama saved the American economy in the face of unprecedented Republican sabotage:Now, past performance is no guarantee of future results. Still, there's no mystery as why Republicans in general and businessmen in particular have faltered so badly as stewards of the U.S. economy. Just as your government isn't like your family, it's not a business either. The federal government's mission isn't to earn profits for shareholders, but "to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity." It is precisely when families and businesses are tightening their belts that government should spend more and take on more debt. CEO's can generally count on their orders being put into practice; American presidents cannot. The separation of powers and the political process itself, Barbara Perry of the University of Virginia's Miller Center explained, are "meant to preclude models and skills used in the corporate world." As Richard Neustadt famously defined it, "Presidential power is the power to persuade." Former businessman turned Minnesota Republican Rep. William Frenzel offered this prescient warning to Trump's ilk four years ago:Especially when, like Donald Trump, you badly deserve the abuse for announcing policies that represent suicide for the U.S. economy—and an insult to the intelligence of the American people.Consider, for example, Trump's promises that his $12 trillion tax cut proposal is "going to cost me a fortune" and that he can magically eliminate the national debt "over a period of eight years." His pledges are neither true nor mathematically possible.Now, Donald Trump has said that his tax returns are "none of your business." His reticence might have something to do with the fact many analysts suspect his claims of a $557 million income for 2015 and wealth "in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS" are bogus. Regardless, Len Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center concluded of Trump's tax proposal in December:Berman has it exactly right. Ending the carried interest exemption, as Trump, Clinton and Sanders have all proposed, will hit hedge fund managers and private equity titans like Mitt Romney, but generally not real estate tycoons. But the Donald's call to reduce the top marginal income tax rate from 39.6 to 25 percent could mean millions more for his coffers each year. His new 15 percent tax rate for business owners and corporations, down from the current percent corporate statutory rate of 35 percent, could benefit Trump as well. (A similar business owners' pass-through tax in Kansas cost the state hundreds of millions in lost revenue.) On top of that, the elimination of the estate tax paid by less than a quarter of one percent of all fortunes would redirect billions of Trump's supposed $10 billion wealth from the United States Treasury to his heirs. As Washington Post fact checker Glenn Kessler explained in his Four Pinocchio review of Trump's claim that his tax plan "is going to cost me a fortune":If Trump is to be believed, his annual income puts him among the top 400 taxpayers in the country. And as the Tax Policy Center found, The Donald's plan on average hands the top 0.1 percent of earners a $1.3 million annual tax cut. And that gargantuan tax cut pay day for plutocrats, combined with Trump's commitment to boost defense spending and that pledge to erase the national debt in eight years, would necessarily require gutting federal spending by about 80 percent, reductions so draconian that the U.S. economy might never recover.Once again, basic math is not the friend of Businessman-President Trump:Leaving aside Trump's eight-year time frame compared the CBO's 10-year forecast, we're talking about cutting $40 trillion from a $51 trillion budget—approximately 78 percent. And it's not just that Trump literally can't get there from here. The U.S. economy would be a devastated hellscape if he could get anywhere close. As ThinkProgress pointed out when a balanced budget amendment was being kicked around Congress four years ago, even those comparatively modest cuts would produce an economic calamity on the scale of the Great Depression:That's hardly a plan to "Make America Great Again."But Trump's plans for tax cuts and the national debt (including his apocalyptically ignorant scheme to "make a deal" to get Uncle Sam's creditors to accept less) aren't the only cases in which the self-proclaimed pride of Wharton is unencumbered by the rules of math and the market. As ThinkProgress noted, Trump was just "blowing smoke" when he told coal miners in West Virginia and Pennsylvania that "they're going to start to work again, believe me." Appalachian coal jobs have been disappearing for three decades as cheaper mines elsewhere, lower-cost natural gas and plummeting Chinese demand have wiped out most of the industry's employment. Hell will freeze over before the Indiana air conditioning giant shifting production to Mexico is "They're going to call me and they are going to say 'Mr. President, Carrier has decided to stay in Indiana." As for the 35 and 45 percent tariffs CEO Trump would respectively slap on Mexican and Chinese imports, the Washington Post, the New York Times and CNBC all warned a crippling economic blowback from the ensuing trade war. An analysis prepared by Moody's Analytics found that:Unfortunately, the United States would fall into recession, too. Up to 4 million American workers would lose their jobs. Another 3 million jobs would not be created that otherwise would have been, had the country not fallen into a trade-induced downturn.But we're getting ahead of ourselves. You don't have to look at the havoc writ large President Trump would wreak on American workers and taxpayers. The pathological dishonesty of Businessman Trump has already left many bankrupt and jobless in its wake.To be sure, this week's revelations about Trump University make that abundantly clear. (If it fielded sports teams, Trump University would be in the same conference with Ponzi State, Madoff Tech, Milken U and Baylor.)  "A fraudulent scheme" that "preyed upon the elderly and uneducated to separate them from their money" (as former manager Ronald Schnackenberg described it), Trump University also represents what Brian Beutler called a "devastating metaphor for the Trump campaign." If Mitt Romney, as Mike Huckabee famously said, "looks like the guy who fired you," increasingly Donald Trump will remind voters what it was they hated about Mitt Romney:Devastating, just like it was for the employees of the now-defunct Trump University, Trump Airways, Trump Casino and Trump Magazine. Catastrophic, too, for his business partners. As USA Today reported Wednesday, during his career Trump and his various business entities have been involved in litigation an almost incomprehensible 3,500 times. (Those cases include the fraud case against Trump University, a lawsuit against the Better Business Bureau, ongoing litigation surrounding the Trump Casino bankruptcy, and the fall-out from a group of Hong Kong investors he stiffed.)  Donald Trump admitted in a New Jersey bankruptcy court that "I don't like the 'b' word." But he doesn't hesitate to boast about it as a routine business tactic, either. As he explained to ABC in 2011:During a Republican presidential debate last fall, Trump bragged about his businesses that went bankrupt in 1991, 1992, 2004 and 2009:As it turns out, the con jobs he did then are the same one he's pulling on gullible American voters now. As he explained the secret of the Trump grift in his 1987 book, The Art of the Deal:I call it truthful hyperbole. It's an innocent form of exaggeration -- and a very effective form of promotion.To put it another way, you can fool some of the people all of the time, and that is Donald Trump's target market. And as his Republican White House rival Marco Rubio put it in February, it's always been that way:The only thing that's changed for Businessman Donald Trump is that would-be President Trump has a new name for his marks: Voters.

	                            El escritor y periodista se ha pateado «La España vacía» y la refleja en las páginas de su último título. Un ensayo sobre nuestra identidad, nuestros mitos y nuestros iconos
	                        El joven Sergio del Molino (Madrid, 1979), el que devoraba gofres en la estación de Sol, no hubiera esperado que el Sergio del Molino mayor acabara escribiendo sesudas disertaciones sobre España. Tampoco que estaría vivo a estas alturas. Se imaginaba siempre más apátrida que otra cosa. En su intento de buscarse y contarse a sí mismo ha encontrado por el camino a su propio país. Para eso necesitaba pateárselo.El autor acaba de publicar un ensayo llamado «La España vacía» (Turner) en el que analiza nuestro singular éxodo rural (AKA El Gran Trauma), desmonta ciertos mitos urbanitas sobre la gente que vive en los pueblos y se asoma a algunos de los iconos rurales patrios por antonomasia, como Cayo (el del disputado voto), Puerto Hurraco o «Las Hurdes» buñuelescas. «Portugal es Lisboa y sus paisajes. Y España es Madrid, y el resto ni siquiera es paisaje».Los españoles tradicionalmente hemos sentido desprecio por nuestro paisaje interior, lo consideramos un secarral y un erial. El paisaje español se descubre con la generación del 98. Hasta entonces hay un enorme complejo de inferioridad y envidia por el paisaje verde francés. Nos sentimos un poco desnudos y miserables por no tener ese país tan húmedo y verde. Y, de hecho, algunos proyectos de Joaquín Costa intentaron convertir desiertos en vergeles, crear unas redes de canales para irrigar el desierto y convertirlo en algo fértil. Y apreciarlo todavía sigue siendo minoritario y raro. Mi mujer mismo cuando dije «cómo me inspira el paisaje de la estepa», me dijo: «Es que tú eres un raro, esto no le gusta a nadie». Ellos, aunque el 27 más que el 98, buscan en su propia tierra esa construcción de la belleza que Proust hace al recrear Combray. Me parece que es un paso audaz, y que en su espíritu europeísta tuvo mucha importancia. Incluso se ponen muy místicos. A algunos, sobre todo a Unamuno, se les va la mano, se pierden. Y buena parte de la mística de la generación del 98 es el germen del programa de Falange española. Machado es otra cosa, más íntimo, reflexivo y autobiográfico. Se apropia del paisaje de una forma más moderna. Por eso creo que a Machado podemos leerle hoy y Unamuno nos repele.Dice que Azorín se adelanta 20 años a los beatniks.Como también le pasa a Unamuno, aunque a Azorín de una forma más íntima, es que se exaltan con el paisaje, parece que les está dando en la cabeza, que el sol les ha afectado… Y en la actitud de Azorín ante el paisaje reconozco rasgos de los beatniks cuando hablan del desierto de Arizona o cuando Ginsberg y, sobre todo, Burroughs hablan de Tánger. Parece que está contemplando el paisaje con un estado alterado de conciencia, con el mismo alucinamiento.¿Cuál es nuestro Gran Trauma?Es el gran éxodo rural que no es muy diferente al resto de sociedades industriales. La diferencia con España es que es muy tardío, cien años después de Reino Unido y Francia. Y muy traumático porque sucede en poquito tiempo, en 20 años. De repente una ciudad como Madrid pasa de tener un millón a tener tres millones en 20 años. Barcelona, lo mismo. Pueblecitos que eran de las afueras se convierten en nada en ciudades de 100.000. Y, a la vez, un montón de pueblos se vacían. En otros países no fue tan de golpe y tuvieron muchos más años para asimilarlo, y nosotros aún estamos en el proceso de digerir ese cambio de nación. Hay millones de personas en España que lo vivieron, pertenece a la memoria viva de mucha gente.¿El joven Sergio del Molino que se zampaba los gofres en Sol hubiera esperado que el actual Sergio del Molino se interesara por temas tan enjundiosos?No, se imaginaba más apátrida que otra cosa. No sé si tiene que ver con la edad... Aunque tampoco creo que ese joven tuviera muy claro que estaría vivo a estas alturas. He superado mi esperanza de vida. Yo siempre cuento que vivía aquí en Bravo Murillo con una bruja, con una chica que echaba las cartas, y que era muy maja, aunque por supuesto estaba zumbada... Y me dejó inquieto por lo que me dijo, aunque luego descubrí el truco psicológico por lo que me conocía y me podía manipular. Me leyó la mano y me dijo que tenía la línea de la vida muy corta, profunda y de final muy abrupto. Como tengo una conciencia de la muerte muy... Yo de pequeño pisé un clavo que me hizo una herida en el pie. Y había una leyenda urbana que decía que los yonkis se iban a pinchar a la playa en los años 80 y dejaban las jeringuillas hacia arriba para que la gente se pinchara, porque eran muy malos los yonkis. Me convencí con ocho años de que tenía el sida y me iba a morir. Y lo asumí con mucha naturalidad. Cuando ella me dijo que moriría pronto, me encajaba. Superar los treinta años ha sido muy sorprendente.Se pone a viajar por los pueblecitos de España. ¿Qué descubre?Descubro que vive muy poca gente y que los censos no son acertados, que pone que viven doscientas personas y, a lo mejor, solo viven diez. Vive gente, y me sorprende, por elección. Porque podría estar en otros lugares mucho más cómodos, con más servicios. Viven en pueblecitos donde hacer cada recado significa un dolor. Y hay mucha gente que está atrapada y con un gran resentimiento hacia el Estado. A mí lo que me ha sorprendido es lo silenciados que están. Llevan allí toda la vida y se sienten abandonados, absolutamente desatendidos. Pues cuando les quiten las Diputaciones...Totalmente. Desde el invierno, cuando nieva y su pueblo se queda aislado, y nadie pasa por allí, que no tienen escuela, servicios mínimos...¿Entienden que es complicado en los pueblos de siete personas?Lo entienden y no lo entienden, porque ellos entienden que son ciudadanos en un Estado que garantiza la igualdad, por lo que el hecho de vivir en un lugar retirado no debería de privarles de los derechos que disfrutan el resto de los ciudadanos. Sienten que están marginados, orillados. Y es un sentimiento secular, que se ha ido trasladando de generación en generación. Y que en ocasiones ha tenido manifestaciones políticas muy violentas como el carlismo. El carlismo lo que consiguió es darles orgullo, un sentimiento de dignidad, de utilidad, y de identidad que no les daba el Estado. El carlismo les dijo que su forma de hablar, de vida, su folclore, su catolicismo, tenía algún sentido, eran dignos. Aunque su propósito era cambiar la estructura de Gobierno de una manera absolutista. No consiguen eso, pero sí establecerse en el campo. Tuvieron un gran don de la oportunidad.Totalmente. Propugnaban un estado absolutista no centralizado. El carlismo abogaba por una especie de Estado confederal con un Rey muy poderoso y sin democracia ninguna. Aunque luego sí que aceptan la democracia, pero no un estado centralista. Ellos apoyaban los fueros y la cultura y costumbres locales. Pero no logran sus objetivos políticos, y hay un grupo de gente que desarrolla el discurso carlista, lo lleva a un extremo y lo transforma en nacionalismo. Si el carlismo hubiera triunfado no habrían surgido los nacionalismos. De ahí surge, mucho tiempo después, ETA y, en síntesis, los dos grandes nacionalismos. Además es que cronológicamente se ve. Unos años más tarde del último alzamiento de 1890, en el 92 y 95, surgen las bases de Manresa en Cataluña y se funda el PNV en Euskadi. Hay una consecuencia directa, hay un trasvase de dirigentes y militantes. Muchos nacionalistas han sido carlistas al principio.Alistarse en el Carlismo era como hacer la Yihad, comenta.Un poco sí, quien se alistaba conscientemente. Era un movimiento muy amplio que tenía sus fanáticos pero también tenía mucha gente de carril. Era un movimiento integrista que quería un estado teocrático, exactamente igual que el Irán de los ayatolás o de cualquier estado islámico que quiere la supremacía religiosa. En ese momento había gente que se alistaba en el carlismo porque eran integristas católicos. Valle Inclán apoyaba un movimiento que iba contra él.El carlismo pretendía destruir todo lo que representaban él y otros. Lo que más odiaba el carlismo era la cultura liberal, artística y bohemia, y ellos son un producto muy refinado de la cultura urbana. Hubieran sido barridos. Si hubiera triunfado el carlismo los hubieran colgado de una farola a todos o les hubieran ahogado en un pilón. Y, sin embargo, ellos están a favor de un movimiento que les desprecia. A mí me parece bonito¿Qué hay en la España vacía?La España vacía para un madrileño serían las tres horas que van de Madrid a Gandía… La España vacía física es un mapa arbitrario para contar lo que a mí me interesa. Serían las dos Castillas, Madrid (salvo la capital, que es «un agujero negro»), Extremadura, Aragón, un poquito de Murcia, del norte de Andalucía, de Valencia y del interior de Galicia. Es un territorio muy extenso y en él vive muy poquita gente. Si quitas las capitales de provincia viven solo 4 millones de personas en todo ese territorio. Con las capitales serían cerca de siete, en un territorio parecido a Italia, donde viven 60 millones.Ningún dictador ha maltratado tanto la España rural como Franco.Franco, como líder de un proyecto nacionalista autoritario y muy violento, buscó lo eterno español. Y lo exaltó. Dijo que actuaba en nombre de esos campesinos… Su movimiento quería destruir Madrid y volverla a levantar porque la consideraban una especie de Babel, una especie de puticlub tremendo que no se merecía seguir siendo España si no se purificaba con catolicismo. Pero durante su dictadura se produce la industrialización, el Gran Trauma, y él aceleró y magnificó ese sufrimiento de los campesinos. Incluso les sacó a punta de pistola de sus casas para construir pantanos. Fue inmisericorde con la gente del campo, porque había unos planes muy parecidos a los de la Unión Soviética de industrializar el país muy rápido. Si había que llevar a millones de personas a que vivieran en chabolas, se llevaba. No tuvo la menor consideración con la gente que en su retórica oficial era la gente que encarnaba la verdadera España. Era una doble moral, una hipocresía absoluta, en la que no nos solemos fijar.En su libro aparece el Señor Cayo, el mítico personaje de Delibes, y su venganza. Y habla de la sobre-representación que tienen los pequeños municipios en la política española pero que luego por la disciplina de partido, en realidad, no acaban beneficiándose de ello. ¿No sería entonces la venganza contra el Señor Cayo?Es paradójico, es una venganza paradójica o pírrica, quizá. Está bien visto, porque no le sirve de nada. El señor Cayo es el trasunto de Delibes, que sabe mucho, es el gran narrador de lo que está pasando en España y de su vaciamiento, de la destrucción de una cultura y de un país dentro de un país. Él lo ve muy bien y lo cuenta en sus obras. El país está muy volcado en europeizarse, muy pendiente de otras cosas… Y él, desde su Valladolid, desde sus caminatas por la meseta y su afición por la caza, percibe como se está arruinando aquello. Es un testigo directo. En esta novela en concreto es capaz de anticipar la jugada que quieren hacer con el sistema electoral. Eso que ahora comentamos tanto con el tema de la circunscripción, y cómo los políticos iban a las pequeñas aldeas a hablar para ganarse el voto rural, que era muy importante para conseguir mayorías... Ve claramente la jugada de cómo esa España emergente va a utilizar a la España rural, como siempre la ha utilizado. Y lo cuenta muy emotivamente.La «nueva política» dice que va a cambiar el sistema. A ver, hay una declaración de intenciones porque han sido perjudicados directamente por este sistema y querrán cambiarlo. Pero solo podrán cambiarlo cuando sean beneficiarios de ese sistema. Y la paradoja es ésa. En el momento en el que puedan cambiarlo es porque habrán conseguido implantación rural y habrán dado ese salto cualitativo que les da la mayoría. Y conseguida esa mayoría, me pregunto: ¿vas a cambiar un sistema que en las siguientes elecciones te va a quitar 30 diputados? Todavía no he visto a un partido que haga una ley que le quite de cuajo un 15% de los diputados que tiene. Sería muy raro. ¿Miguel Grima, el alcalde de Fago, fue asesinado porque en su pueblo no había un bar de tapas?Es un prejuicio que tenemos la gente de ciudad respecto a los pueblos muy pequeñitos, que los consideramos sociedades muy asfixiantes en las cuales la gente al final acaba matándose. Pero estadísticamente no se sostiene esa teoría, son tan anecdóticos como en la ciudad. Es probable que ese aislamiento y la asfixia llevaran al crimen. Pero porque se juntó un grupo de personas que no lo soportaban. Son esas personas en concreto, no su entorno, lo que hace que se produzca el crimen. Igual Miguel Grima en una ciudad estaría vivo, pero porque no estaría a merced del loco.Solo se vuelve a los pueblecitos cuando hay un suceso truculento.Esa es su principal queja, que no tienen presencia nacional. Hay mucho sentimiento de agravio en ese sentido. Y yo siempre les digo: “Si quieres salir en las noticias, cógete una recortada y cárgate a cuatro. Te sacan seguro”. Los pueblos tienen esa sensación, que solo reciben atención cuando sucede algo muy feo y terrible en ellos. Como solo recibimos información de ellos por estas cosas, tenemos la sensación de que se están matando todo el tiempo. Fomenta el estereotipo. Por eso era muy interesante el programa de Labordeta, la normalización, buscar otra mirada... Un relato que además es muy limpio, que muestra los pueblos como son, sin intervenir demasiado en el discurso. Y Tierno Galván, de repente, era de pueblo.Descubre el populismo y le funciona muy bien venderse como un chico de pueblo, y no de la capital, en un momento en el que la gran masa de votantes de Madrid viene del pueblo y tiene pueblo. Creo que esa mayoría absoluta se debe a esa proximidad y a esa forma en que se vende. Pero era de Madrid. Su padre sí que era de pueblo, pero él ni siquiera lo pisó. Se vende como «yo soy un soriano que vino a la capital como vosotros que vinisteis de vuestros pueblos…». Creo que es ilustrativo sobre hasta qué punto el imaginario de los pueblos de la España vacía influía dentro de la configuración de lo que era Madrid después del exilio rural.«Las Hurdes, tierra sin pan», de Luis Buñuel, es «una película de monstruos y aventuras exóticas».Sí, es el infierno que me busco cuando me lean los buñuelistas, es una interpretación muy personal. A mí me parece de cierta impostura intelectual que Buñuel se acerque a las Hurdes como si fuera la Polinesia, como si fuera un viaje de aventuras. Generacionalmente es gente que ha crecido con Salgari, con la literatura de aventuras del s.XIX, con los exploradores,… Y el cine de monstruos y de aventuras está muy de moda en ese momento, y él lo ve. Me sorprende mucho que adopte ese esquema para su viaje a las Hurdes cuando él proviene de la España vacía. Él es de Calanda y no le podría extrañar tanto lo que ve en las Hurdes. Aunque venga de familia rica y se criara en Zaragoza. Y luego ya está demostradísimo que es un falso documental. Pero él se empeñó en decir que era real, que era «rigurosamente objetivo». Era una estrategia propagandística. De ahí la frase de Max Aub: «A Buñuel le importa más la justicia que la verdad».Él quiere agitar el panorama. Es un filme propagandístico y por eso insiste en que es verdad, como el de Acción contra el hambre insiste que su spot es verdad. Yo he visto varias veces un spot con un niño que cada vez se llama de una manera… ¿Ese niño de dónde es? Y él hace eso mismo, quiere provocar una reacción visceral del público, de esto es intolerable. Agitación pura. En esa época Buñuel era muy cercano al partido comunista. No estaba afiliado, no se llegó a demostrar, pero está muy próximo en un momento en el que el PC está asumiendo la doctrina de Stalin de agitar mucho el ambiente. Viene de estar con los surrealistas en París y está muy concienciado, quiere levantar a las masas… Y dentro de las Hurdes fue a elegir los peores pueblos. Cuando llega Buñuel a las Hurdes ya llevaban diez años de inversión, ya hay carreteras, se han abierto escuelas, el Estado está interviniendo. Ya no son las Hurdes que visita Alfonso XIII en el 22. Estamos en el 34 y han pasado 12 años de inversión continuada. Hay inversión real y eso Buñuel lo obvia. Todo lo que fuera positivo lo suprime. Y se va a El Gasco, que es el único pueblo donde no ha llegado la intervención. Pero todavía no le basta y hace que la gente escenifique. Y dice que la niña que sale murió poco después del documental… Esa mujer vivió hasta el año 96. Hay gente que está haciendo el baile de San Vito, pero está escenificando. O el funeral del bebé muerto, que lo llevan por un río porque no hay cementerio en el pueblo; el bebé estaba dormido, no estaba muerto. Hacen el teatrillo, está completamente demostrado. Y no pasa nada porque se explica por el contexto de la época, no va en detrimento de Buñuel. Lo que va en su detrimento es la defensa acérrima que hacen algunos buñuelistas de por qué hizo lo que hizo. Y además a él le importa un bledo, lo dice en las conversaciones con Max Aub: «El objetivo que buscaba lo cumplí». La cinta de las Hurdes no gusta mucho allí, creen que ha formado una leyenda negra que les ha estigmatizado y les ha impedido desarrollarse y vivir en una cierta normalidad en el país. Viajas por las Hurdes y no hay apenas referencias al documental y, sin embargo, sí que hay referencias a otros como Unamuno, a Alfonso XIII,…Es non grato allí, vamos.Sí. Alfonso XIII cuando hizo el viaje en el año 22 pues hay una hospedería, un restaurante, hay una ruta que se puede hacer a caballo o andando que se llama Alfonso XIII,… Han seleccionado la memoria que quieren, una más positiva. Y han rechazado la memoria de «Las Hurdes», no quieren saber nada de Buñuel.Habla de Fox Mulder, el de «Expediente X», como la enésima reencarnación del Quijote. Y también sostiene que «con los creyentes no cabe ciencia, que una mirada inteligente y compasiva debería no burlarse de ellos y no refutarles, debería tratar de entender por qué quieren creer». ¿Por qué no se les puede refutar?Se les puede refutar, pero creo que hay cierta altivez intelectual que no lleva a ninguna parte y que está demás. Siempre digo: «Mídete con tus iguales». Sobre los cervantistas o historiadores, si en tal pueblo creen tal cosa, ¿qué más da? Déjales. No discutas con ellos, no hacen daño a nadie. Estoy hablando de poner una placa de «El Quijote pasó por aquí»… No pasa nada. Voy a la mitificación del pasado y de la historia. Probablemente es un pasado falso y refutado por la historiografía: ¿y qué? Es como dejar a tu abuela que rece. No pasa nada, discute de otras cosas, discute con tus iguales. A ver, creo que la medicina debe alertar de las supercherías, pero de otras cosas que no hacen daño, pues déjales. ¿Qué importancia le otorga a la figura del maestro de pueblo? Un amigo les define como los soldados de infantería de la cultura.Un poco eso, sí. Y tienen mucha importancia. Es muy interesante lo que está pasando porque son todos gente joven, que no tienen plaza, y les mandan a sitios que no quiere ir nadie, hasta que son interinos, y logran plaza y pueden ir a la ciudad. Es gente muy motivada, muy joven, que pasa muy poquito tiempo en el pueblo. Ese para mí es el mayor problema, que están dos años o tres y que no pueden hacer un proyecto duradero. Podría haber incentivos para quedarse allí a vivir. Ahora mismo los campos y los pueblos no ofrecen ninguna alternativa para que gente cualificada se quede, porque no tienen nada que hacer allí salvo morirse del asco. Tienen problemas también con la sanidad. El otro día escuchaba que faltan especialistas en hospitales pequeños porque no se cubren las plazas. Tienen un gran problema para reclutar a personas de nivel. Así que acaban yendo personas que están empezando y que van a estar poquito tiempo, y muy bien intencionada y con entusiasmo, pero que aguanta poco. O la morralla, la gente que no le queda más remedio que estar allí porque son malos. Y eso es un drama terrible.La reflexión sobre España forma cada vez más parte de su proyecto literario.A través de la crónica familiar, como me pasó en mi anterior novela, al ir contándome a mí mismo y al ir yendo hacia detrás buscando las raíces de mi identidad, me he ido encontrando con algo inesperado que es mi país. Yo tenía la sensación no de ser cosmopolita, que es muy idiota, pero sí tenía mucho desapego. Este ensayo es una reflexión muy meticulosa y va ocupando un espacio cada vez más central. Y va unido a la convicción además de que la narrativa tiene que apelar a la nación, a un aquí y a un ahora, a tus contemporáneos. Los novelistas franceses escriben sobre Francia, los norteamericanos sobre Estados Unidos,... Y los españoles hemos renunciado a escribir sobre los españoles por diversas razones, probablemente la mayoría de ellas legítimas. Yo intento retomar esos puentes rotos, que creo que están rotísimos. Y volver a una narrativa que vuelva al ser español. Yo escribo para los españoles del aquí y del ahora.«La España de la que provienen millones de españoles ya no existe, se ha reformulado», cuenta al final. ¿Ha escrito un ensayo sobre un fantasma?Sí. Está en las casas, en las mitologías familiares. Realmente la España vacía está en Madrid, en Barcelona, en Valencia, en Bilbao, está en las casas de la España llena. Y pervive en los álbumes de recuerdos. Está en la construcción de la identidad que los hijos y los nietos del exilio rural han hecho ya desde la España urbana, en cómo han reinventado sus mitos familiares y cómo vuelven a ellos. Y que puede ser una forma de cohesión social que no hemos explorado, basada en la historia íntima y familiar y no en el Canto del Mío Cid, ni la conquista de América, ni en alguien que escachó la cabeza a un moro. Basada en algo mucho más sutil, para vertebrar un país mucho más sofisticado y vivible, que no marca distancias tribales entre el «ellos y el nosotros», sino que construya una identidad mucho más compleja y más rica de compartir.------Ahora vamos a hablar un poco de periodismo. En una ocasión entrevistó a los padres de una víctima del 11-M. «Si tuviera un poco de dignidad me levantaría, pediría perdón y me iría», escribió mucho después. Estos padres le felicitaron por el reportaje. «Un periodista tiene que tener la cintura flexible y una mandíbula de gran abertura», afirma.Es el único consuelo que me queda (sobre la felicitación de los padres). Creo que los periodistas hacemos muy poca autocrítica y sobrevaloramos en exceso nuestro papel. Nos vendría bien una pequeña cura de humildad. En ese sentido, está la gran mentira de Kapuściński de que los cínicos no valen para este oficio. Cualquiera sabe que el cinismo es una gran aptitud profesional que te permite llegar muy lejos en esta profesión. Yo iba allí en contra de todos mis principios. Lo hice por un prurito de profesionalidad. Me tragué mis escrúpulos morales y pensé que lo hacía bien, que estaba siendo un buen profesional. No estaba siendo un melindroso, estaba actuando como un periodista. Y a veces usamos la profesionalidad como coartada para saltarnos muchas líneas morales. Y eso no es una cuestión no de los medios sino de nosotros como periodistas individuales. Decisiones que nosotros tomamos, y que es verdad que nos pueden perjudicar. Yo creo que en mi carrera tomar algunas decisiones, o no tomarlas, me ha perjudicado notablemente. Y podía haber tenido una vida mucho más cómoda si me hubiera tragado mis escrúpulos en algunas ocasiones que ya contaré en algún momento. He visto como gente que no tenía esos escrúpulos le ha ido muy bien en la vida. Estas cuestiones pueden parecer menores tal como estamos pero a mí me parecen nucleares. «Los cínicos no valen para este oficio, yo creo que sí que valen. Creo que el que no vale soy yo»Sí, por eso me he salido o me han echado, no lo sé muy bien. Me he sentido expulsado. Me he ido porque me han abierto la puerta. Yo no me siento capacitado para ejercer el periodismo. Lo puedo ejercer pero de una manera muy naif, no me veo. No por tragaderas morales ni por nada, sino porque requiere de unas aptitudes que yo no tengo. La cuestión de la voz, por ejemplo. Hasta qué punto me siento yo legitimado de poner voz y de hacer encajar a terceros en estereotipos cuando ellos mismos son capaces de poner voz ellos mismos. Es un problema nuclear de mi literatura, de quién habla, de quién cuenta... No es lo mismo que cuentes tú tu vida que que la cuente yo. Hasta qué punto tengo yo derecho a contar tu vida. Es una cuestión moral y casi técnica, de cómo puedo impostar tu voz. Mi literatura se ha vuelto muy autobiográfica y «primerapersonista» por eso. Yo no encajo en el periodismo que se hace actualmente. A la gente como yo, a los que nos hemos curtido haciendo grandes reportajes o entrevistas muy largas, el periodismo actual no les quiere, somos totalmente inútiles. No estoy idelizando el pasado tampoco. Antes el periodismo era un lugar muy hostil y muy de señoritos, una profesión muy elitista, muy bronca y muy chunga. Cualquiera que haya conocido una redacción en los 90 cuando estaban todavía los periodistas viejos, que tenían la botella de whisky y que estaba llena de humo,… Eran sitios verdaderamente hostiles para alguien medio sensible. A las primeras mujeres que empezaron a trabajar en los años 70 en esos nidos de testosterona y puterío, las admiro muchísimo. ------Para finalizar, me gustaría preguntarle sobre «La hora violeta», el libro que cuenta el diagnóstico y tratamiento de su hijo Pablo de leucemia hasta su muerte. ¿Vuelve a Saskatoon? («Saskatoon Tonight» es una canción country, de NQ Arbuckle, que Del Molino se solía poner para intentar evadirse momentáneamente durante ese durísimo periodo. La Saskatoon del título es una localidad canadiense).Sí, de vez en cuando vuelvo, me pongo esa canción. Me cuesta pero de vez en cuando sí que viajo allí. «La hora violeta» es un libro... Dentro de dos semanas viajo a no sé dónde para hablar de este libro, vengo de China ahora. Es un libro que tres años después me sigue acompañando. Y creo que no pasa un mes sin que no tenga un acto relacionado con «La hora violeta». Es un libro muy persistente, y me temo que va a seguir persistiendo. En ese sentido, por un lado, es una bendición, porque es fabuloso que el libro se mantenga vivo y siga ganando lectores. Y que siga provocando debate y emociones. Pero para mí también es una carga. Yo quiero mantener vivo el recuerdo de mi hijo, pero a la vez es una profecía autocumplida. Al final me he condenado yo mismo a estar en esa hora violeta, no puedo culpar a nadie más que a mí. Es verdad que al escribir ese libro y seguir con el impacto, y que vuelva una y otra vez a él, pues me hace dilatar esa hora violeta. La usaba de forma metafórica pero estoy viviendo en ella. ¿Qué le dicen los lectores cuando le hablan de «La hora violeta»?En general se sienten muy dentro del libro, establecen una conexión muy emocional y visceral, que a mí a veces me agarrota, me rebasa. Las reacciones que provoca «La hora violeta» a veces me han superado. Viene mucha gente a contarte su propia historia, se producen catarsis. Es muy emocionante pero yo siento que no lo controlo. Casi estoy más cómodo hablando de «La España vacía» que cuando voy a un acto sobre «La hora violeta», porque no sé cómo va a terminar, con una intensidad muy poderosa que va a escapar a mi control. Eso a veces me cuesta manejarlo, porque los lectores han establecido una conexión muy íntima conmigo y parece que me reclaman algo. Y yo no sé qué es lo que me reclaman ni lo que puedo darles. Es una sensación muy extraña.Amaba la ligereza y se transformó en un padre trágico. ¿Cambió su escritura?Sí, cambió todo. Mi forma de ver el mundo, mi sensibilidad,... Soy una persona totalmente distinta, no tengo nada que ver. Cambia mi forma de enfrentarme al mundo y mi literatura es mi forma de enfrentarme al mundo, no tengo nada que ver. De hecho, me cuesta reconocer mis libros anteriores, parece que las ha escrito otro. No me reconozco en la frivolidad. Echo de menos la vocación frívola de antes, me gustaría ser mucho más frívolo. Me he vuelto más serio… ¡Me he puesto con España, que es lo más serio que hay! ¡Es terrible! Los temas que elijo... Vengo del porno,… La primera novela era pornográfica. Antes intentaba elegir temas frívolos también. Creo que antes era más divertido y mejor persona. El tío de antes era mejor que el de ahora. Por ejemplo, yo no sé si el tío de ahora se ligaría a su mujer como se lo ligó el de antes. Creo que soy peor, y lo echo de menos. En «De vidas ajenas», Emmanuel Carrère sostiene que la comunicación es balsámica. ¿Está de acuerdo?Radicalmente en desacuerdo. No puede ser balsámico estar dándole vueltas a la herida, es como hurgar en la herida. Es mucho más doloroso, se te infecta. Hay un mito que viene del psicoanálisis que dice que comunicar y expresar tiene un efecto sanador. Es mentira. No puede tenerlo. Otra cosa es que yo no quiera sanarme, vivir en el recuerdo y no negarlo. Porque forma parte de mí y tiene que estar presente en mi vida. Pero no es nada terapéutico, lo he rechazado siempre de plano. Toda la retórica terapéutica de la escritura... Lo último que le recomendaría a alguien que quiere recuperarse de un trauma es que escriba sobre ello. Escribe sobre ello si de verdad tienes las agallas para enfrentarte a ti mismo y afrontar las consecuencias. Para curarte, no, es pensamiento mágico. ¿Qué pasa, que lo dejas en un papel y ahí se quedan tus demonios? Eso es como hacer vudú, es una idiotez. No tiene base real. Mi problema es que se murió mi hijo. No lo voy a recuperar ni nadie me lo va a traer. Son problemas que no tienen solución. El problema es que tienes que aprender a vivir con ello. Pero no es el camino más correcto estar todo el tiempo volviendo sobre ello, a lo mejor no lo soportas.¿Contempla dejar de participar en actos relacionados con el libro?No, yo creo que, al menos a corto plazo, seguiré... Si me llaman, vamos. Es que he elegido eso, porque soy capaz y quiero. Es mi vida, es el dolor que yo llevo conmigo.El Bosco se corona como rey del Museo del Prado en una exposición única con la mayor concentración de sus obras maestras reunidas hasta la fechaRestaurante La CabraTeatro Bellas ArtesTeatro Calderón

http://www.eldiariony.com/2016/04/29/lideres-politicos-promueven-ciudadania-de-cara-a-las-elecciones/

Lunes 06 de Junio 2016Este viernes, termina la campaña Citizenship Now, que durante toda la semana atendió unas 12 mil llamadas de neoyorquinos interesados en recibir información y asistencia sobre asuntos migratorios, y que mayormente pretende motivar a más personas a convertirse en ciudadanos.La campaña, promovida por CUNY y el New York Daily News, con el apoyo de de El Diario, contó con el respaldo de líderes políticos que hicieron un llamado a los neoyorquinos que cumplen con los requisitos para que accedan a la ciudadanía, a fin de poder votar en las eleciones presidenciales de noviembre y parar a los candidatos que están promoviendo el odio y la división.“Involucrarse en las elecciones haciéndose ciudadanos es una manera de parar el discurso de odio antiinmigrante de Trump y Cruz, a través del voto”, comentó el senador José Peralta, quien agregó que es muy importante tomar en serio el creciente apoyo que está recibiendo Donald Trump, pues si la gente no sale a votar, podría llegar a la Casa Blanca.“Ninguna elección es fácil y hay que tomar a este candidato en serio. Al principio muchos lo veían como un payaso indefenso, pero ahora no nos podemos dormir ante lo que está haciendo, pues la ola de odio que está promoviendo ha levantado muchos seguidores y los que estamos en contra de ese mensaje tenemos que hacernos sentir en las elecciones”, dijo.Peralta agregó que con la intención de que más neoyorquinos reciban asistencia legal y no caigan en manos de abogados estafadores, desde el Senado estatal promoverá un proyecto que asigne recursos para que las oficinas de los líderes políticos tengan un programa para asuntos de ciudadanía e inmigración durante todo el año.Asimismo, la concejal Vanessa Gibson dijo que el Concejo de Nueva York apoyó la campaña Citizenship Now con $1 millón, porque los inmigrantes que viven en la Gran Manzana son una prioridad para la ciudad.“Tenemos que seguir apoyando esta campaña y tenemos que dar más recursos para garatizar que este programa siga y asegurarnos de que la gente sepa que seguimos comprometidos con ellos”, comentó la representante de El Bronx, quien de paso hizo un llamado para que más gente se haga ciudadana y evite que el país sea manejado por líderes que promueven la división.“Hay que salir a votar contra esa retórica antiinmigrante, antimujeres, antiLGBT que ellos están promoviendo. Ese mensaje de construir muros y divisiones en vez de unir, no es bueno para nadie y si nos quedamos callados y no votamos, estamos diciendo que aceptamos ese discurso que va a llevar al país a dar pasos hacia atrás”, agregó.Allan Wernick, director de la campaña Citizenship Now, calificó la iniciativa como todo un éxito, pues no solo superaron las llamadas del año pasado (7,395) sino que además contaron con el apoyo de muchos representantes de la Ciudad, el Concejo y hasta la Iglesia.“Con la presencia de los visitantes que tuvimos durante la semana, apoyando la campaña, envíamos un mensaje claro a los inmigrantes. Les estamos diciendo que no necesitan tener miedo, porque en Nueva York los políticos, los periódicos, los medios, los abogados y hasta el cardenal, están con ellos”, comentó Wernick, quien insistió en que es importante seguir trabajando en pro de una reforma migratoria.“Los estadounidenses estamos con los inmigrantes y los apoyamos. Muchos de nosotros creemos que hay que darles papeles a todos los que están contribuyendo a la sociedad. Por eso que los ciudadanos tienen que actuar y decir: ‘se oye, se siente, la gente está presente’. Eso hace el cambio”, concluyó.
UN ÉXITO TOTAL
-Durante la campaña se recibieron alrededor de 12 mil llamadas.
-Un grupo de 67 abogados expertos atendió casos directamente.
-400 voluntarios de diferentes nacionalidades e idiomas, ayudaron a asistir las llamadas.
-En el 2015 se recibieron 7,395 llamadas
-En los 14 ediciones de la campaña, se ha ofrecido ayuda a casi 160 mil personas.
-El próximo 14 de mayo habrá un evento masivo en el John Jay College de Manhattan para atender personalmente a unas 700 personas que se incribieron para recibir asistencia.
• Uno de los objetivos primordiales de la campaña es que haya nuevos ciudadanos que ejerzan su derecho al voto en las elecciones presidenciales de noviembre.
• Además de español, las líneas prestaron ayuda en idiomas como italiano, creole, francés y mandarin, entre otros.#VotaLatino2016#VotaLatino2016 Hillary Clinton 3 horas hace Trump's bigoted comments about a Latino judge are so disgusting, even other Republicans are offended. ...

La precandidata a la presidencia de los Estados Unidos por el partido democrata Hillary Clinton arremetió este sábado contra su contrincante a la Casa Blanca, el republicano Donald Trump.Hillary Clinton escribio en su cuenta de twitter: “Trump no tiene el derecho de definir quién es y no es parte de este país. Nos definen los valores—no la intolerancia”, refieriendose a la posición del magnate frente a los inmigrantes extrangeros en el país norteamericano. Trump no tiene el derecho de definir quién es y no es parte de este país. Nos definen los valores—no la intolerancia.	— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) 4 de junio de 2016Este mensaje lo escribió después de realizar otra publicación en la que acompañada de un video describe que “Estados Unidos es un país de diversas creencias y patrimonios.

america is a country of diverse beliefs and heritages. that makes us strong, regardless of what donald thinks.

https://sojo.net/articles/white-not-why-country-great

Image via bikeriderlondon/Shutterstock.comWhite Christian nationalism is back in full force. White Christians will need to do everything in their power to stop it — even those of us who avoid politics. When interviewed about Donald Trump’s success last week on NPR, former Republican presidential candidate and adviser to three presidents Pat Buchanan argued for a white, homogenous America, claiming that diversity of language and culture undermines our nation.White nationalism is idolatry, plain and simple. As Christians our allegiance is to God, not to the American flag. “God’s country” is not the U.S.A but the whole human race, which is created in the image of God — no matter the race, no matter the religion. Our biblical alarm bells should go off when we hear candidates or neighbors say the U.S. is more special to God than other countries, particularly if it's that our whiteness is what makes us great. This is heresy. White Christians living in America — a country which likes to view itself as having somehow having God’s special blessing — need to remind our people of who we are as Christians and Americans. We are not special because God loves us more. If we are special it is because we have shown God’s love in fighting back the baser, ungodly human instinct to denigrate and exclude other races. We have often fallen short on this. But sometimes as a nation, driven by higher values, we have dismantled systems that perpetuate racism, bigotry, and intolerance so that all God’s people can bring their talents to build this nation. Don’t mistake me for not loving my country — I’m proud often to be an American. The thing I’m most proud of is the fact that my son can sit next to people from all over the world and all races in his classroom. He barely knows how unique that is, but I know it will make him stronger and smarter. I’m proud that leaders in my home state of Georgia desegregated public schools so that I could have a privilege my parents did not have — to learn from and with my African American brothers and sisters. I’m proud that my country sent me overseas as a Peace Corps volunteer to share with another country and culture — that has made me stronger. I’m grateful for the Southern Baptist Church, which sent me to work one summer among migrant workers on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. I learned how hard immigrants work; how much we share the same dreams; how they have made this nation stronger.Such experiences can teach us the truth of human existence: we have nothing to fear from each other. The only thing we need to fear is our own fear of the other: a fear Jesus repeatedly told us to let go of as he lovingly encountered Samaritans, lepers, outcast women. God did not give us a spirit of fear, but a spirit of power, love, and self-discipline. Voices like Buchanan lack that self-discipline. They have embraced fear, and unchecked will tear this country apart. Not all of us feel comfortable critiquing political candidates, but there is much we can still do. As CEO of Faith in Public Life, I am inspired by what faith leaders are doing. Around the country, clergy are preaching on how Christians should relate to Muslims, immigrants, gun violence. Churches are holding inter-racial dialogues. They are providing legal services to children from Central America fleeing gang violence. They are sheltering Syrian families, Muslim and Christian, mentoring them as they join this great country. Our voices matter this election cycle. Let's call our fellow Christians to their better angels.The Rev.

when trump insults muslims or immigrants, he should remember that muslims and immigrants serve in our armed forces.

http://time.com/4355797/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-foreign-policy-speech-transcript/

Hillary Clinton tore into presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump during a speech on national security Thursday, casting him as “unfit” for the presidency and offering a preview of her general election campaign message.“Donald Trump’s ideas aren’t just different – they are dangerously incoherent,” she said. “They’re not even really ideas – just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds, and outright lies.”Here are her full remarks from the event in San Diego, California:HILLARY CLINTON: Thank you, thank you so much. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you San Diego for that warm, warm welcome and thanks to Ellen for those moving words, her introduction, and for reminding us it’s not only our men and women in uniform that serve our country, it’s their families, their spouses, their children, and we are grateful to each and every one of them. I want to recognize and thank Congressman Scott Peters for being here, thank you very much.[Applause]And all of the other electeds and service members, active duty and retired National Guard and Reservists, veterans, military spouses, family members, all who are with us today.On Monday, we observed Memorial Day – a day that means a great deal to San Diego, home of so many active-duty and former military and their families. We honor the sacrifice of those who died for our country in many ways – by living our values, by making this a stronger and fairer nation, and by carrying out a smart and principled foreign policy.That’s what I want to speak about today – the challenges we face in protecting our country, and the choice at stake in this election.It’s a choice between a fearful America that’s less secure and less engaged with the world, and a strong, confident America that leads to keep our country safe and our economy growing.[Applause]As Secretary of State, Senator and First Lady, I had the honor of representing America abroad and helping shape our foreign policy at home. As a candidate for President, there’s nothing I take more seriously than our national security. I’ve offered clear strategies for how to defeat ISIS, strengthen our alliances, and make sure Iran never gets a nuclear weapon. And I’m going to keep America’s security at the heart of my campaign.[Applause]Because as you know so well, Americans aren’t just electing a President in November. We’re choosing our next commander-in-chief – the person we count on to decide questions of war and peace, life and death.And like many across our country and around the world, I believe the person the Republicans have nominated for President cannot do the job.[Applause]Donald Trump’s ideas aren’t just different – they are dangerously incoherent. They’re not even really ideas – just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds, and outright lies.[Applause]He is not just unprepared – he is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility.[Applause]This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes – because it’s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.[Applause]We cannot put the security of our children and grandchildren in Donald Trump’s hands. We cannot let him roll the dice with America.This is a man who said that more countries should have nuclear weapons, including Saudi Arabia.This is someone who has threatened to abandon our allies in NATO – the countries that work with us to root out terrorists abroad before they strike us at home.He believes we can treat the U.S. economy like one of his casinos and default on our debts to the rest of the world, which would cause an economic catastrophe far worse than anything we experienced in 2008.[Applause]He has said that he would order our military to carry out torture and the murder of civilians who are related to suspected terrorists – even though those are war crimes.He says he doesn’t have to listen to our generals or our admirals, our ambassadors and other high officials, because he has – quote – “a very good brain.”[Laughter]He also said, “I know more about ISIS than the generals do, believe me.” You know what? I don’t believe him.[Applause]He says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese, and he has the gall to say that prisoners of war like John McCain aren’t heroes.Exactly.He praises dictators like Vladimir Putin and picks fights with our friends – including the British prime minister, the mayor of London, the German chancellor, the president of Mexico and the Pope.[Applause]He says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia.And to top it off, he believes America is weak. An embarrassment. He called our military a disaster. He said we are – and I quote – a “third-world country.” And he’s been saying things like that for decades.Those are the words my friends of someone who doesn’t understand America or the world.And they’re the words of someone who would lead us in the wrong direction. Because if you really believe America is weak – with our military, our values, our capabilities that no other country comes close to matching – then you don’t know America.[Applause]And you certainly don’t deserve to lead it.That’s why – even if I weren’t in this race – I’d be doing everything I could to make sure Donald Trump never becomes President – because I believe he will take our country down a truly dangerous path.Unlike him, I have some experience with the tough calls and the hard work of statecraft. I wrestled with the Chinese over a climate deal in Copenhagen, brokered a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, negotiated the reduction of nuclear weapons with Russia, twisted arms to bring the world together in global sanctions against Iran, and stood up for the rights of women, religious minorities and LGBT people around the world.[Applause]And I have, I have sat in the Situation Room and advised the President on some of the toughest choices he faced.So I’m not new to this work. And I’m proud to run on my record, because I think the choice before the American people in this election is clear.I believe in strong alliances; clarity in dealing with our rivals; and a rock-solid commitment to the values that have always made America great. And I believe with all my heart that America is an exceptional country – that we’re still, in Lincoln’s words, the last, best hope of earth. We are not a country that cowers behind walls. We lead with purpose, and we prevail.And if America doesn’t lead, we leave a vacuum – and that will either cause chaos, or other countries will rush in to fill the void. Then they’ll be the ones making the decisions about your lives and jobs and safety – and trust me, the choices they make will not be to our benefit.That is not an outcome we can live with.As I see it, there are some important things our next President must do to secure American leadership and keep us safe and our economy growing in the years ahead. These are all areas in which Donald Trump and I profoundly disagree. And they are all critical to our future.First, we need to be strong at home.That means investing in our infrastructure, education and innovation – the fundamentals of a strong economy. We need to reduce income inequality, because our country can’t lead effectively when so many are struggling to provide the basics for their families. And we need to break down the barriers that hold Americans back, including barriers of bigotry and discrimination.[Applause]Compare that with what Trump wants to do. His economic plans would add more than $30 trillion – that’s trillion with a “t” – $30 trillion to our national debt over the next 20 years. He has no ideas on education. No ideas on innovation. He has a lot of ideas about who to blame, but no clue about what to do.None of what Donald Trump is offering will make America stronger at home. And that would make us weaker in the world.Second, we need to stick with our allies.America’s network of allies is part of what makes us exceptional. And our allies deliver for us every day.[Applause]Our armed forces fight terrorists together; our diplomats work side by side. Allies provide staging areas for our military, so we can respond quickly to events on the other side of the world. And they share intelligence that helps us identify and defuse potential threats.Take the threat posed by North Korea – perhaps the most repressive regime on the planet, run by a sadistic dictator who wants to develop long-range missiles that could carry a nuclear weapon to the United States.When I was Secretary of State, we worked closely with our allies Japan and South Korea to respond to this threat, including by creating a missile defense system that stands ready to shoot down a North Korean warhead, should its leaders ever be reckless enough to launch one at us. The technology is ours. Key parts of it are located on Japanese ships. All three countries contributed to it. And this month, all three of our militaries will run a joint drill to test it.That’s the power of allies.[Applause]And it’s the legacy of American troops who fought and died to secure those bonds, because they knew we were safer with friends and partners.Now Moscow and Beijing are deeply envious of our alliances around the world, because they have nothing to match them. They’d love for us to elect a President who would jeopardize that source of strength. If Donald gets his way, they’ll be celebrating in the Kremlin. We cannot let that happen.[Applause]That’s why it is no small thing when he talks about leaving NATO, or says he’ll stay neutral on Israel’s security.It’s no small thing when he calls Mexican immigrants rapists and murderers. We’re lucky to have two friendly neighbors on our land borders. Why would he want to make one of them an enemy?[Applause]And it’s no small thing when he suggests that America should withdraw our military support for Japan, encourage them to get nuclear weapons, and said this about a war between Japan and North Korea – and I quote – “If they do, they do. Good luck, enjoy yourself, folks.”I wonder if he even realizes he’s talking about nuclear war.Yes, our friends need to contribute their fair share. I made that point long before Donald Trump came onto the scene – and a number of them have increased their defense spending. The real debate here is whether we keep these alliances strong or cut them off. What he says would weaken our country.Third, we need to embrace all the tools of American power, especially diplomacy and development, to be on the frontlines solving problems before they threaten us at home.Diplomacy is often the only way to avoid a conflict that could end up exacting a much greater cost. It takes patience, persistence and an eye on the long game – but it’s worth it.Take the nuclear agreement with Iran. When President Obama took office, Iran was racing toward a nuclear bomb. Some called for military action. But that could have ignited a broader war that could have mired our troops in another Middle Eastern conflict.President Obama chose a different path. And I got to work leading the effort to impose crippling global sanctions. We brought Iran to the table. We began talks. And eventually, we reached an agreement that should block every path for Iran to get a nuclear weapon.Now we must enforce that deal vigorously. And as I’ve said many times before, our approach must be “distrust and verify.” The world must understand that the United States will act decisively if necessary, including with military action, to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. In particular, Israel’s security is non-negotiable. They’re our closest ally in the region, and we have a moral obligation to defend them.[Applause]But there is no question that the world and the United States, we are safer now than we were before this agreement. And we accomplished it without firing a single shot, dropping a single bomb or putting a single American soldier in harm’s way.[Applause]Donald Trump says we shouldn’t have done the deal. We should have walked away. But that would have meant no more global sanctions, and Iran resuming their nuclear program and the world blaming us. So then what? War? Telling the world, good luck, you deal with Iran?Of course Trump doesn’t have answers to those questions. Donald Trump doesn’t know the first thing about Iran or its nuclear program. Ask him. It’ll become very clear, very quickly.There’s no risk of people losing their lives if you blow up a golf-course deal.[Laughter]But it doesn’t work like that in world affairs. Just like being interviewed on the same episode of “60 Minutes” as Putin was, is not the same thing as actually dealing with Putin.So the stakes in global statecraft are infinitely higher and more complex than in the world of luxury hotels. We all know the tools Donald Trump brings to the table – bragging, mocking, composing nasty tweets – I’m willing to bet he’s writing a few right now.[Applause]But those tools won’t do the trick. Rather than solving global crises, he would create new ones.He has no sense of what it takes to deal with multiple countries with competing interests and reaching a solution that everyone can get behind. In fact, he is downright contemptuous of that work. And that means he’s much more likely to end up leading us into conflict.Fourth, we need to be firm but wise with our rivals.Countries like Russia and China often work against us. Beijing dumps cheap steel in our markets. That hurts American workers. Moscow has taken aggressive military action in Ukraine, right on NATO’s doorstep. Now I’ve gone toe-to-toe with Russia and China, and many other different leaders around the world. So I know we have to be able to both stand our ground when we must, and find common ground when we can.That’s how I could work with Russia to conclude the New START treaty to reduce nuclear stockpiles, and with China to increase pressure on North Korea. It’s how our diplomats negotiated the landmark agreement on climate change, which Trump now wants to rip up.[Applause]The key was never forgetting who we were dealing with – not friends or allies, but countries that share some common interests with us amid many disagreements.Donald doesn’t see the complexity. He wants to start a trade war with China. And I understand a lot of Americans have concerns about our trade agreements – I do too. But a trade war is something very different. We went down that road in the 1930s. It made the Great Depression longer and more painful. Combine that with his comments about defaulting on our debt, and it’s not hard to see how a Trump presidency could lead to a global economic crisis.And I have to say, I don’t understand Donald’s bizarre fascination with dictators and strongmen who have no love for America. He praised China for the Tiananmen Square massacre; he said it showed strength. He said, “You’ve got to give Kim Jong Un credit” for taking over North Korea – something he did by murdering everyone he saw as a threat, including his own uncle, which Donald described gleefully, like he was recapping an action movie. And he said if he were grading Vladimir Putin as a leader, he’d give him an A.Now, I’ll leave it to the psychiatrists to explain his affection for tyrants.[Applause]I just wonder how anyone could be so wrong about who America’s real friends are. Because it matters. If you don’t know exactly who you’re dealing with, men like Putin will eat your lunch.Fifth, we need a real plan for confronting terrorists.As we saw six months ago in San Bernardino, the threat is real and urgent. Over the past year, I’ve laid out my plans for defeating ISIS.We need to take out their strongholds in Iraq and Syria by intensifying the air campaign and stepping up our support for Arab and Kurdish forces on the ground. We need to keep pursuing diplomacy to end Syria’s civil war and close Iraq’s sectarian divide, because those conflicts are keeping ISIS alive. We need to lash up with our allies, and ensure our intelligence services are working hand-in-hand to dismantle the global network that supplies money, arms, propaganda and fighters to the terrorists. We need to win the battle in cyberspace.[Applause]And of course we need to strengthen our defenses here at home.That – in a nutshell – is my plan for defeating ISIS.What’s Trump’s? Well he won’t say. He is literally keeping it a secret. The secret, of course, is he has no idea what he’d do to stop ISIS.Just look at the few things he’s actually said on the subject.He’s actually said – and I quote – “maybe Syria should be a free zone for ISIS.” Oh, okay – let a terrorist group have control of a major country in the Middle East.Then he said we should send tens of thousands of American ground troops to the Middle East to fight ISIS.He also refused to rule out using nuclear weapons against ISIS, which would mean mass civilian casualties.It’s clear he doesn’t have a clue what he’s talking about. So we can’t be certain which of these things he would do. But we can be certain that he’s capable of doing any or all of them. Letting ISIS run wild. Launching a nuclear attack. Starting a ground war. These are all distinct possibilities with Donald Trump in charge.And through all his loose talk, there’s one constant theme: demonizing Muslims and playing right into the hands of ISIS’. His proposal to ban 1.5 billion Muslims from even coming to our country doesn’t just violate the religious freedom our country was founded on. It’s also a huge propaganda victory for ISIS. And it alienates the very countries we need to actually help us in this fight.A Trump Presidency would embolden ISIS. We cannot take that risk.This isn’t reality television – this is actual reality.[Applause]And defeating global terrorist networks and protecting the homeland takes more than empty talk and a handful of slogans. It takes a real plan, real experience and real leadership. Donald Trump lacks all three.And one more thing. A President has a sacred responsibility to send our troops into battle only if we absolutely must, and only with a clear and well-thought-out strategy. Our troops give their all. They deserve a commander-in-chief who knows that.I’ve worked side-by-side with admirals and generals, and visited our troops in theaters of war. I’ve fought for better health care for our National Guard, better services for our veterans, and more support for our Gold Star families. We cannot put the lives of our young men and women in uniform in Donald Trump’s hands.Sixth, we need to stay true to our values.Trump says over and over again, “The world is laughing at us.” He’s been saying this for decades, he didn’t just start this year. He bought full-page ads in newspapers across the country back in 1987, when Ronald Reagan was President, saying that America lacked a backbone and the world was – you guessed it – laughing at us. He was wrong then, and he’s wrong now – and you’ve got to wonder why somebody who fundamentally has so little confidence in America, and has felt that way for at least 30 years, wants to be our President.The truth is, there’s not a country in the world that can rival us. It’s not just that we have the greatest military, or that our economy is larger, more durable, more entrepreneurial than any in the world. It’s also that Americans work harder, dream bigger – and we never, ever stop trying to make our country and world a better place.[Applause]So it really matters that Donald Trump says things that go against our deepest-held values. It matters when he says he’ll order our military to murder the families of suspected terrorists. During the raid to kill bin Laden, when every second counted, our SEALs took the time to move the women and children in the compound to safety. Donald Trump may not get it, but that’s what honor looks like.[Applause]And it also matters when he makes fun of disabled people, calls women pigs, proposes banning an entire religion from our country, or plays coy with white supremacists. America stands up to countries that treat women like animals, or people of different races, religions or ethnicities as less human.[Applause]What happens to the moral example we set – for the world and for our own children – if our President engages in bigotry?And by the way, Mr. Trump – every time you insult American Muslims or Mexican immigrants, remember that plenty of Muslims and immigrants serve and fight in our armed forces.[Applause]Donald Trump, Donald Trump could learn something from them.That brings me to the final point I want to make today – the temperament it takes to be Commander-in-Chief.Every President faces hard choices every day, with imperfect information and conflicting imperatives. That’s the job.A revolution threatens to topple a government in a key region, an adversary reaches out for the first time in years – what do you do?Making the right call takes a cool head and respect for the facts. It takes a willingness to listen to other people’s points of view with a truly open mind. It also takes humility – knowing you don’t know everything – because if you’re convinced you’re always right, you’ll never ask yourself the hard questions.I remember being in the Situation Room with President Obama, debating the potential Bin Laden operation. The President’s advisors were divided. The intelligence was compelling but far from definitive. The risks of failure were daunting. The stakes were significant for our battle against al Qaeda and our relationship with Pakistan. Most of all, the lives of those brave SEALs and helicopter pilots hung in the balance.It was a decision only the President could make. And when he did, it was as crisp and courageous a display of leadership as I’ve ever seen.Now imagine Donald Trump sitting in the Situation Room, making life-or-death decisions on behalf of the United States. Imagine him deciding whether to send your spouses or children into battle. Imagine if he had not just his Twitter account at his disposal when he’s angry, but America’s entire arsenal.Do we want him making those calls – someone thin-skinned and quick to anger, who lashes out at the smallest criticism? Do we want his finger anywhere near the button?I have a lot of faith that the American people will make the right decision. This is a country with a deep reservoir of common sense and national pride. We’re all counting on that.[Applause]Because making Donald Trump our commander-in-chief would be a historic mistake. It would undo so much of the work that Republicans and Democrats alike have done over many decades to make America stronger and more secure. It would set back our standing in the world more than anything in recent memory. And it would fuel an ugly narrative about who we are – that we’re fearful, not confident; that we want to let others determine our future for us, instead of shaping our own destiny.That’s not the America I know and love.So yes, we have a lot of work to do to keep our country secure. And we need to do better by American families and American workers – and we will. But don’t let anyone tell you that America isn’t great. Donald Trump’s got America all wrong. We are a big-hearted, fair-minded country.[Applause]There is no challenge we can’t meet, no goal we can’t achieve when we each do our part and come together as one nation.Every lesson from our history teaches us that we are stronger together. We remember that every Memorial Day.This election is a choice between two very different visions of America.One that’s angry, afraid, and based on the idea that America is fundamentally weak and in decline.The other is hopeful, generous, and confident in the knowledge that America is great – just like we always have been.[Applause]Let’s resolve that we can be greater still. That is what I believe in my heart.I went to 112 countries as your Secretary of State. And I never lost my sense of pride at seeing our blue-and-white plane lit up on some far-off runway, with “The United States of America” emblazoned on the side. That plane – those words – our country represents something special, not just to us, to the world. It represents freedom and hope and opportunity.I love this country and I know you do too. It’s been an honor and a privilege to serve America and I’m going to do everything I can to protect our nation, and make sure we don’t lose sight of how strong we really are.Thank you all very much.Your browser is out of date.

rt  hillary clinton is the better candidate to take on trump

https://www.rt.com/usa/345309-clinton-bashes-trump-speech/

Clinton lambasted Trump while speaking in San Diego on Thursday afternoon, saying that "feeding global terrorist networks and defending the homeland takes more than empty talk and a handful of slogans. It takes a real plan."But despite her efforts to slam Trump, she didn't seem to tell her supporters what she would actually do after moving into the White House. One could argue, it seems, that her speech was just full of "empty talk."“As a liberal, I know that Donald Trump doesn’t know anything about foreign policy, and I know all the things that she said about him yesterday, which is fine,” RT America’s Ed Schultz said. "But, Hillary, I want to know where you stand ‒ and especially going into this California primary ‒ what your foreign policy is.”“We know Trump isn’t qualified, we know he’s a bonehead, we know he doesn’t know what the hell he’s talking about, and we know that his ego overrides everything that he does, and going on Twitter isn’t a policy,” Schultz added. “But with your experience, Mrs. Clinton, you should be at least able to tell us exactly what you’re going to do with the Middle East.”“The question is this: How far are you willing to go to stop ISIS? And are you going to take California kids and put them on the ground in Syria? That’s what people want to know!” he concluded.

. "ideas" are really just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds, and outright lies.

http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/06/02/clinton-blasts-trumps-foreign-policy-of-bizarre-rants-personal-feuds-and-outright-lies/

Hillary Clinton just tried to out-Trump Donald Trump.Taking the stage in San Diego for what her campaign billed as a major national security speech, Clinton excoriated the mogul’s ever-evolving and often unworkable foreign-policy pronouncements with new lines that sounded even sharper than the blunt insults Trump loves to lob at his opponents.“Donald Trump’s ideas aren’t just different; they are dangerously incoherent,” she said in a strikingly combative and sarcastic speech. “They’re not even really ideas — just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds, and outright lies.” Calling him “temperamentally unfit” for the presidency, she continued, “this is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes — because it’s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.”Elsewhere in the roughly 30-minute address, Clinton accused Trump of cozying up to Vladimir Putin and mocked him for saying that “he has foreign-policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia.”The contrast with Clinton’s typically earnest and restrained tone was particularly striking given her tightly managed campaign, which has largely tried to avoid getting down in the mud with Trump.But the strategy dismissing Trump as “unfit” to be commander in chief risks alienating some Democrats who may see the likely Democratic nominee as too hawkish and over-eager to wield U.S. military force herself. Clinton’s rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, has questioned her judgment — reserving particular scorn for her vote in favor of the Iraq war — and vowed to remain in the race past California’s primary on June 7 and into the Democratic convention in July. The tactic also opens Clinton’s lengthy record up to harsher scrutiny, a potential vulnerability against Trump, a Manhattan real-estate magnate who has never served in public office and has no votes or moves to tout or defend. Though she has far more extensive foreign-policy experience, it includes her initial support for the invasion of Iraq and her role in pushing a reluctant President Barack Obama toward deeper military involvement in Afghanistan and Libya, policies which have failed to bring stability to either country. It’s a difficult balance that has Clinton has struggled to strike during the bitter fight with Sanders, and which would probably be even harder in her general election matchup with Trump. A Washington Post/ABC news poll last month showed slightly more American voters trust Clinton to handle national security issues than Trump, but they’re roughly split, 47 percent to 44 percent, putting the results within the survey’s margin of error. Independents, though, lean more toward Trump, with 50 percent saying he’d make the country safer versus 39 percent who say Clinton would. In her speech Thursday, Clinton didn’t mention these more complex areas of her tenure in the Obama administration. Instead, she again cited watching the Osama bin Laden raid in the White House Situation Room, negotiating a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas and a nuclear weapons deal with Russia, and helping lay the groundwork for Obama’s historic deal with Iran over its nuclear program and the Paris climate accords. And she highlighted the value of U.S. alliances Trump has vowed to pull back from, arguing they give Washington an effective “qualitative edge” over global rivals Beijing and Moscow. “If Donald gets his way, they’ll be celebrating in the Kremlin,” she said, repeating a variation of a favored line.Many of Trump’s national security prescriptions — whether threatening to reduce the U.S. role in NATO, encouraging Japan and South Korea to develop their own nuclear weapons, or expressing admiration for strongmen like Putin or North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un — have been criticized as dangerous, from both sides of the aisle. But in a marked shift in tone, Clinton excoriated those pronouncements with new lines that sounded, well, a little more like the mocking reality-TV show mogul. “I’ll leave it to the psychiatrists to explain his affection for tyrants,” she quipped. Noting Trump’s comment that he doesn’t have to listen to military officials, “because he has — quote — ‘a very good brain,’” she paused for comic effect.  “He also said, ‘I know more about ISIS than the generals do, believe me.’ You know what? I don’t believe him.”Belittling the purported business acumen that Trump cites as his main qualification for office,  she said, “There’s no risk of people losing their lives if you blow up a golf-course deal.” She described his “tools” of statecraft as “bragging, mocking, composing nasty tweets,” arguing they’d create global crises, not solve them. The Clinton camp sees some retired military officers, GOP elected officials, and former Republican national security officials who have vowed “Never Trump” as potential recruits, an unlikely alliance that underscores how her doctrine, in many ways, is more hawkish than Obama’s or Trump’s. Yet even as she spoke Thursday, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) published an op-ed expressing support for the mogul, making him the highest-ranking elected GOP official to formally endorse Trump. It’s the strongest signal yet that the last holdouts of the elected Republican establishment are accepting the reality of a Trump-led GOP and turning toward defeating Clinton. It’s unclear whether the Clinton campaign’s gamble will pay off in November. No amount of controversy over Trump’s national security statements seems to have negatively impacted his support in an election cycle where “establishment” is a dirty word and frustration a primary mobilizer. The social media mud-slinging that Clinton mocks but Trump masters also neutralizes her relative qualifications to be commander in chief. And despite current anxiety over terrorism, presidential elections are rarely decided by national security. Still, Clinton put both voters and Trump on notice. “If you really believe America is weak — with our military, our values, our capabilities that no other country comes close to matching — then you don’t know America,” she said. “And you certainly don’t deserve to lead it.”Photo credit: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images The Cable is FP's real-time take on the news driving the day — from the White House to the Pentagon, Capitol Hill to the State Department — and the people and personalities at the center of it all.Situation Report is FP's daily national security news brief.

New polls from CBS suggest Bernie Sanders may perform well against Hillary Clinton in California but that his campaign’s fate will be sealed in New Jersey.California has 475 pledged delegates and 71 unpledged delegates at stake; New Jersey has 126 pledge delegates and 16 unpledged delegates. Depending on how Puerto Rico’s Democratic primary plays out – its 60 delegates could bring Clinton to within a handful of victory – the race could be over very soon.CBS battleground pollsCALIFORNIAClinton 49%Sanders 47%Clinton 48%Trump 33%NEW JERSEYClinton 61%Sanders 34%Clinton 49%Trump 34%

Dickerson asks about the federal judge whom Trump has accused of “bias” because the judge has parents from Mexico. The judge is from Indiana.“I think it has a lot to do with it,” Trump says. “I had a judge previously and it would’ve been a very short case.”He starts rambling about his theory that the case should’ve been dismissed. “The plaintiff in the case was a woman, she was so bad that after the deposition it was over … they went before the judge they said we don’t want her to be the plaintiff. So we said that’s fine you have to dismiss the case.”“How do you allow a case to proceed when the plaintiff asks to be dismissed?”In class action suits that involve a large number of plaintiffs, as does the case against Trump University, it is not unusual to replace the lead plaintiff.Dickerson: what does any of this have to do with the judge having parents from Mexico?Trump interrupts, until Dickerson nearly manages to pin him down to the question.“He’s a member of a club or society very strongly from Mexico, which is fine, but I say he’s got bias. I’m going to build a wall. I’m going to build a wall.”“This judge is treating me very unfairly,” he continues, adding without any evidence or specifics: “there’s something going on.”He again starts talking about the lead plaintiff who was dismissed from the case, before Dickerson interrupts and asks if this were a Muslim judge would they, too, be “biased” because of Trump’s suggestion to “temporarily” ban Muslims from entering the US?Trump: “Uh… it’s possible yes, That would be possible, absolutely.”Dickerson invokes one of the United States’ founding principles: that Americans do not judge each other according to who their parents were, or where they came from.“I’m not talking about tradition, I’m talking about common sense,” Trump says. “He’s not treating me fairly,” he complains. “I’ve had numerous lawyers, I have a case where thousands of people have said it’s a great school … It has nothing to do with anything except common sense.”Trump’s lawyers have not asked the judge to recuse himself. The chief justice of the second circuit court of appeals wrote in 1998  that “matters such as race or ethnicity are improper bases for challenging a judge’s impartiality”. Courts around the US have ruled similarly for decades. Related: 'I maxed out my credit card': Trump University graduates speak out Updated

Dickerson asks Trump about his claims that Hillary Clinton “has to go to jail”.Trump insists that Clinton has done “everything wrong” but speaks only vaguely about how he believes she broke the law in her use of a private email server. “The word judgment,” he says. “Under those rules and regulations, judgment is even criminal.”“Why would a person and how could a person, with this kind of judgment, become the president of the United States,” he continues. This is a cyber world. This is a cyber world. … We’re being hacked all over the place by Russia, by China, probably. … We’re in a cyber world and she’s playing around with servers and emails, who could she be running this country?”Trump says that Clinton should be jailed for being “stupid”.Dickerson has a retort for this: “If stupidity were criminal we’d all be in jail.”

Martin PengellyOver on Fox News Sunday, meanwhile, Newt Gingrich has said Trump’s criticism of judge Gonzalo Curiel is “inexcusable” and one of his “worst mistakes”, but declined to accuse the nominee of racism. Like Mitch McConnell on NBC earlier, he isn’t going to go quite that far.Gingrich also said Trump had to recognize that he is now the “potential leader” of the US, and should thus up his game. This is perhaps an exclusive look at the kind of vice-presidential advice the former House speaker might give should Trump take him into the White House. Though the Trump campaign has reportedly been narrowing its list of potential VPs – and though we don’t know if Gingrich is still on it, or ever was – he does at least fit the profile of such an appointment as outlined by campaign chair Paul Manafort this week: he’s white and male. Anything else would be “viewed as pandering”, according to Manafort.Fox News Sunday also spoke to Clinton campaign chair (and sometime Guardian contributor) John Podesta, about his candidate’s move on to the offensive this week. And he said: “I think the card we’re going to play against Trump is that he has always been for himself. “He’s a self-aggrandiser at the expense of literally thousands of people. And when it comes to Trump University what we learned this week was even his own employees called it a fraudulent scheme.” Related: 'I maxed out my credit card': Trump University graduates speak out Updated

Donald Trump has a second appearance, on CBS’s Face the Nation with host John Dickerson, who asks him about foreign policy.Trump says he doesn’t think that generals know much about the terror group Isis. “They don’t know much because they’re not winning. I think they’re not winning for a different,” he says.“From what I hear, it’s all being run form the White House,” he adds. “I’ve spoken to certain generals” – he won’t say who – and they say it’s being run form the White House, where the commander in chief works. Dickerson asks who. “In one case in office, in one case out of office.”But Dickerson points out that Trump was in fact for intervention in Libya, despite all his claims in the last few months.Trump: “I did? Where did you see that?”Dickerson: “In a video blog from 2011, you said, “Now we should go in. We should stop this guy,” this guy being Ghaddafi, “which would be very easy and very quick. We could do it surgically, stop him from doing it, and save these lives.”Trump: “That’s a big difference from what we’re talking.”Dickerson: But you were for intervention…Trump: “Don’t forget, I’m the only one, I made a lot of money with Ghaddafi, if you remember. He came to the country and he had to make a deal with me because he needed a place to stay, he paid me a fortune, never got to stay there, and it became sort of a big joke. But the fact is that Libya was a disaster from the standpoint of the way it was handled, I mean … “John Dickerson: Wait, what? You were for intervention, just to clear that up? I’m confused … Trump: “I was for something, but I wasn’t for what we have right now.“And right now, Isis has their oil, John, Isis is selling – that’s among the finest oil in the world. Isis has taken over the Libyan oil. And we don’t do blockades, we don’t do anything, they’re selling it, they’re making a fortune with it. So we go out, we do Libya, we do it poorly, as poorly as you can do it. You can’t do worse. And then now, if you look at what’s happened, the result is Isis is selling the oil and it’s a total mess.”Trump insists that he was for a “surgical” strike to kill Ghaddafi alone – an arbitrary assassination, in other words, and he does not admit that the contradiction of his past support for intervention with more recent claims that he opposed any intervention.

Stephanopoulos concludes with questions about Clinton’s email practices while she was secretary of state and about her gun control proposals.He asks first about a scathing State Department report that sharply criticized Clinton’s practices, but Clinton inches her way away from it.I thought that the report made it clear that the practice I used was used by other secretaries … If I had to it over again I certainly wouldn’t, but I think the rules were not clarified until after I had left because it had been the practice of others. There was certainly reason to believe, which I did, which is what I practiced was in keeping with others’ practices. …It was a mistake, I would not do it again, but the rules were not clarified until after I had left, and the first secretary of state who used a government email account was John Kerry, after I had left.“Everybody in the department knew that I was emailing from a personal address,” Clinton promises – even though the State Department found that two staffers had raised concerns about the practice, and warned that her emails could contain federal records that needed to be preserved under law.There were also guidelines about cybersecurity, and warnings about using mobile devices to conduct official business. Clinton did not seek approval from senior information officers, according to the inspector general’s report. There were also reports of hacking attempts, the IG found, though it did not conclude that any attack was successful. The FBI is investigating whether the private server endangered security.Stephanopoulos asks whether Clinton has sat down with agents. “I have not been asked to come in for an interview and I have said I am more than willing,” she says.Finally he asks about her proposals to increase background checks and repeal a liability law that protects gun manufacturers from lawsuits by families of gun victims.Clinton says she will defend the right to bear arms, but that it cannot be a right beyond all limits. “If it is a constitutional right then it is like every constitutional right is subject to regulations.”The words “a well regulated militia” begin the text of the second amendment.“Responsible gun owners have a right, I have no objection to that, but the rest of the American public has a right to [actions] to protect everyone else.” Related: Hillary Clinton's email server violated state department rules, audit finds Updated

Hillary Clinton has joined George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s This Week, and conversation inevitably circles round to Donald Trump.Did you suggest he’s “mentally unstable” in your speech last week, Stephanopoulos asks.Clinton says not quite, but “he makes bizarre rants and engages in personal feuds and outright lies. He does apparently seem to have very thin skin, and I think these attributes, that kind of temperament is unsuited to be our commander in chief.”She keeps it up, calling Trump: “someone who doesn’t tell the truth, doesn’t seem to be bothered by the constant and inherent contradictions, I said that he would not mind other countries having nuclear weapons, including Korea, Japan Saudi Arabia.She continues:His unpredictability, his putting everything in highly personal terms, has rattled … our closest allies … has caused a lot of serous concern around the world, because people are not used to seeing anyone, a Republican or a Democrat, who is so loose with the truth, so divisive, and so dismissive of very legitimate concerns about our safety, our security our values.Clinton picks up on Trump’s attacks on the federal judge as an example, saying it was “very vicious” and without any basis in reality. Judge Gonzalo Curiel is “a judge with an impeccable record as a prosecutor … appointed first by the Republican governor of California, Governor Schwarzenegger, then appointed by a Democratic president, president Obama.”These attacks, she says, are Trump “trying to divert attention from the very serious fraud charges against Trump University that have basically been confirmed by some of the highest officials who worked with him.”“Judge Curiel is as American as I am and certainly as American as Donald Trump is.” Related: Donald Trump on North Korea going to war: 'Good luck, enjoy yourself folks'

Tapper asks Sanders a bit about foreign policy, in particular Hillary Clinton’s suggestion that Donald Trump would quickly land the US in a war because of his apparent inability to handle any criticism.“Trump would be a disaster and she and I agree on that,” Sanders says. Trump gives in to “ugly words about people,” he adds, saying: “he doesn’t to have the temperament.” But he doesn’t mince words about his own misgivings regarding Clinton. He makes great hay of her vote for the Iraq war, and her support for military intervention in Libya while she was secretary of state for Barack Obama.“I worry about that, yeah I do. I think her support for the war in Iraq was not just an aberration. I think her willingness to kind of push President Obama to overthrow Muammar Ghaddafi [is] not inconsistent with her views on Syria where she wants a no-fly zone, which I think could suck us into never ending conflict in that area.”Sanders admits that he sees the argument for intervention, though “in that particular instance” (Libya) he says he would “probably not” have intervened.“You can always make the case: Saddam Hussein was a murdering thug. You can make the case about [Bashar al-]Assad in Syria, my god,” he adds. “But our job is to think about what happens the day after.”Tapper asks whether the world we be better with these autocrats in power. “The world would be better off with these dictators out of power but there are ways to get them out of power without causing mass instability and deaths,” Sanders replies.He draws a few more distinctions with Clinton, for instance her position that hydraulic fracking should be regulated versus his call to ban it outright, and says that he doesn’t like how the philanthropic Clinton Foundation has taken donations from foreign governments.“Do I have a problem when a sitting secretary of state and her husband, a former president [collecting] many millions of dollars from foreign governments that are dictatorships?” Sanders asks rhetorically, citing the lack of free speech, women’s rights, gay rights in Saudi Arabia, as an example. He does have a problem with that. (You can read more about those foreign donations here.)Last question: But will you do everything in your human power to stop Donald Trump from becoming president?Sanders says, without hesitation, that he will.Updated

CNN now airs an interview with Hillary Clinton, in which Jake Tapper asks her about the violence that’s broken out at Donald Trump rallies, recently by anti-Trump protesters.“I condemn all violence in our political arena, I condemned it when Donald Trump was inciting it and congratulating people for [committing it],” Clinton says.“I condemn it when people are [protesting] Donald Trump.”“He created an environment where it seems acceptable,” she says, and “now we’re seeing people who are against him responding in kind. It should all stop! It is not acceptable.”“ I want it to just end,” she says. “I don’t want to parse it, I don’t want to talk [about its politics], the police have a hard enough job trying to make sure that we’re able to gather and talk about the issues facing our country, and Trump has lowered the bar.“Is it a surprise that people who don’t like him are stepping over that bar? I don’t think so.”Tapper moves on to the Democratic primary race, and Clinton waxes confident.“I believe on Tuesday I will have decisively won the popular vote, and I wil lhave decisively won the pledged delegate majority. You can’t get much more than that out of the primary season.”“The contest between then senator Obama and myself was actually much closer,” she says – even going os far to say that by some measure she won the popular vote (she doesn’t provide and specifics). “I ran to become president because I have deep values and beliefs about what should be done in our country,” she says, before drawing similarities with Bernie Sanders. “We both want to raise the minimum wage, we both want to get the universal healthcare coverage, we both want to make sure Wall Street never wrecks Main Street again.”She says that if you look at the campaign, and her and Sanders’ positions, “it’s nothing like what you saw on the Republican side.”She says that after Tuesady she’s going to reach out and do everything she can to unify the Democratic party.

Finally Tapper moves on to ask about Trump University, which the businessman says has had “thousands and thousands of people have said great reviews, great reviews.”“It’s gotten tremendous marks. I don’t mean, like, two people, I mean thousands.”Tapper asks about Trump’s accusation of bias by the federal judge overseeing the lawsuit against the enterprise, which alleges it defrauded people of tens of thousands of dollars.“This judge is of Mexican heritage,” Trump says. “I‘m building a wall, I’m building a wall.The judge, Gonzalo Curiel, was born in Indiana and is an American.“He’s a member of a society that’s very pro-Mexico and that’s fine, that’s fine,” he continues. “I think he should recuse himself.”He then starts a new conspiracy: “Does he know the lawyer on the other side? And a lot of people say yes, and I don’t know, and that’s a problem.”Trump repeats himself over and over again. “I’m building a wall, OK? … He’s of Mexican heritage, and he’s very proud of it, and that’s fine, as I am.”Tapper interrupts, repeatedly: “But he’s an American …”“It’s a case that should’ve been dismissed already,” Trump says. “He lets the plaintiff off the case out.” The case is a class action suit, so the removal of a lead plaintiff is not that unusual.Trump continues: “I’ve had lawyer s come up to me and say you are being treated so unfairly, it’s unbelievable … If he was giving me fair rulings I wouldn’t be talking to you this way.”Trump’s lawyers have not asked the judge to recuse himself. Appellate courts have repeatedly held that “matters such as race or ethnicity are improper bases for challenging a judge’s impartiality”, the second circuit ruled in 1998.Tapper points out that Paul Ryan and Hillary Clinton have lambasted Trump for the remarks.“Paul Ryan doesn’t know the case,” Trump says. “Hillary Clinton is a stiff.”Then he spins yet another conspiracy theory, saying that “these people” have approached attorney generals around the nation trying to induce them to sue – the lawsuit began before the presidential campaigns.“We’re building a wall. He’s a Mexican. We’re building a wall between here and Mexico.”The judge is from Indiana. He is an American. Related: 'I maxed out my credit card': Trump University graduates speak out Updated

Trump weaves and bobs verbally around to talk about his idea that Japan and South Korea should pay the US for the military bases. Those nations do pay for the US presence. But Trump insists that people “never talk about economics, they never talk.”“It’s got to go two ways,” he says.Tapper moves on to the violence that broke out at Trump’s California rally last week. Trump says that protesters are “thugs and they’re agitators. They’re bad people. I think they’re sent by the Democrats.”What proof do you have?Trump: “Uh… Well they’ve got a lot of Bernie signs.”“I would be very strong if I were the police,” he continues. Sheriff Joe Arpaio would not have let a thing like that happen.”Arpaio had to settle last year with the Justice Department over charges that he violated civil and discrimination laws.

Next up Donald Trump appears on CNN’s State of the Union with host Jake Tapper, who’s with all the candidates in California ahead of Tuesday’s primary.Trump invited Tapper to his mansion in Beverly Hills for an interview. Trump tells Tapper “I told you” that he would be the nominee.The host asks about how Republican leader Paul Ryan and others have asked Trump to stop making remarks demeaning other races. “Look he’s a good man he wants what’s best for the party,” Trump says of Ryan.He says he’s going to win the five states voting Friday “by a lot” – he is the only remaining Republican candidate for president.Then he starts talking about Hillary Clinton’s description of him: “thin skin”.“I don’t have very thin skin. I have very strong, very thick skin,” Trump says. “I have a strong temperament, and it’s a great temperament, and it’s a very in control temperament.”He says that evidence of his temperament is in his business record: “Number one bestsellers, one of the bestselling books of all time.”“I’ve been successful in every business I’ve been in. Real estate, one of the most successful. Television, I mean, forget it.”These claims are not exactly true. The Art of the Deal is not even the bestselling business book of all time. Several Trump businesses have gone bankrupt, and he has had failed ventures at a professional football league, an airliner, steaks and more.“You can’t have that success without good temperament,” Trump continues.“I was thinking about the word temperament. We need a strong temperament in this country,” he goes on. “We have people with weak temperaments. And I have a temperament that’s totally in control.”He has another example: “I said I don’t want to go into Iraq,” he says, “and I was 100% right.”Tapper points out that this too is not true. Trump told Howard Stern in 2003, “Yeah, I guess,” about his support for invading Iraq, and did not speak against the war until after it had begun. Tapper says that if Trump has evidence he should provide it.“I think there is evidence, I’ll see if I can get it.”

Next up on Meet the Press is the Libertarian candidate for president, Gary Johnson.Johnson’s third-party run is trying hard to lure Republicans disaffected by Donald Trump and Democrats who distrust Hillary Clinton.“Most people are fiscally conservative and socially liberal, and most people recognize that our military interventions” create more problems than solve, Johnson says.“I don’t think I’m going to be a spoiler in this, I think really it’s a draw from both sides.”Johnson points out that his running-mate is Bill Weld, another former Republican governor from a mostly Democrat state (Johnson governed in New Mexico, Weld in Massachusetts). Todd asks for philosophy: what should the federal government regulate?“Less government. I mean, smaller government,” he says. Government, in his mind, should “protect us against individuals groups, corporations, foreign governments that would do us harm.“I’m going to sign off on any reduction on agencies,” Johnson continues, avoiding specifics. “I think that we should provide a safety net, i just think we’ve gone way over the line in defining those who are in need.”As of military intervention, Johnson says Congress should get back to declaring war rather than arbitrary drone use, special forces strikes, etc. Todd presses him hard abotu when it would be the right decision to intervene militarily, as in Bosnia in the 1990s, for instance.Johnson hedges: “How about having a skeptic at the table with regard to these military interventions?”Back to the election: if your candidacy helps elect Donald Trump would thatSuccessful candidacy would be talking about issues that aren’t being talkeda bout right now. Johnson says his quest at the moment is to get onto the presidential debate stage, which requires 15% in the polls.He ends with a little spiel about libertarianism, saying it always comes down to “a person’s right to choose. Always come down on the right of choice.”

First up this morning is Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, the chief Republican in Congress aside from House Speaker Paul Ryan.McConnell is on NBC’s Meet the Press with host Chuck Todd, who asks McConnell about his fellow Louisville, Kentucky, native: the late legend Muhammad Ali.The Republican says he was proud to have come from the same town. “He sort of moved beyond some of the controversial positions he took on early in life and he sort of became the most interesting man in the world.”Then he plays a series of clips of McConnell’s statements about Donald Trump: admissions that he disagrees with a lot of what Trump says, that Trump is extremely unpopular, that he’s a “different kind” of candidate.“I think eight years of Barack Obama’s administration is enough,” McConnell tells Todd. “Whatever you think about Donald Trump, he’s certainly a different direction and I think that’s what the country needs.”What about his rhetoric about “rapist” Mexicans and banning Muslims?“I am concerned about the Hispanic vote,” McConnell concedes. “America’s changing.”He notes that the white population of the US has been declining for decades. “I think it’s a big mistake for our party to write off Latino Americans, [who are] soon to be if not already the largest minority in our country.”McConnell says he wants Trump to get his act together: “I hope he’ll change his direction .”But he insists that Republicans will be unified. “You unify the party by not settling scores” of the primary election, he says. “We’re all behind him now and I’d like to see him reach out and pull us all together and give us a real shot of winning this November.”Todd asks about the federal judge who Trump has declared “biased” in a Trump University fraud lawsuit, saying the judge’s Hispanic ethnicity makes him “Mexican” and creates a “conflict of interest”.“I couldn’t disagree more with [that] statement,” McConnell says.Todd: Is that a racist statement?McConnell repeats that he completely disagrees.“This is a man who was born in Indiana,” McConnell says of the judge. “All of us came here from somewhere else almost all Americans, like my wife who came here at age eight and couldn’t speak a word of English, or whose ancestors were risk takers who came here and made this country great.”The NBC host tries a different tact: what would the party of Abraham Lincoln make of this rhetoric?“I think the party of Lincoln wants to win the White House,” McConnell says. “Donald Trump has won the nomination the old fashioned way.”Anything is better than Hillary Clinton, McConnell says.“Is he the perfect candidate? He isn’t. But we have a two party system … I’d rather be working with Donald Trump. For one thing he’d put the right person on the supreme court. … He’s going to be right of center.”As for Senate re-election races, McConnell says that senators are running races independently of Donald Trump. “We don’t know what’s going to happen,” he says. “But the se Senate races are big enough to stand on their own two feet and that’s how.”Updated

Hello and welcome to our rolling coverage of the final days of the 2016 primary elections for president.Bernie Sanders is making a final push for an upset in California, defying calls from Democrats to concede that he is nearly out of the race, mathematically. Hillary Clinton has unleashed her satirical wits at the presumptive Republican nominee, even as she and her husband campaign in Los Angeles to fend off Sanders.And Donald Trump keeps insisting that an American federal judge is, despite his Indiana birth certificate, Mexican – “we believe”. Last week the judge ordered documents released in the lawsuit alleging that Trump University was a scam to defraud people of tens of thousands of dollars. Trump did not like this decision, which revealed his former employees calling the enterprise a “total lie”. All three candidates face the press this Sunday morning.Sanders is hoping for overwhelming turnout in California, but will need surprising and significant wins in other states this Tuesday to have any chance at preventing Clinton from winning the nomination outright. Polls show Clinton ahead of Sanders by double-digits in New Jersey, meaning she could clinch a victory before ballot centers in the Golden State close. She also won most if not all of the Virgin Island’s seven delegates on Saturday’s Democratic caucuses.Crisis-riddled Puerto Rico, which votes Sunday in the Democratic race, has 60 delegates at stake and could put Clinton – needing only 60 for victory, per the AP – on the brink of the nomination.Trump meanwhile continues to enrage and alienate new groups of Americans with language that frustrates his would-be allies. After the press revealed that he had not sent checks to veterans’ groups, as promised, he sent those checks and held a press conference to single out reporters as “sleaze”, “disgusting” and “a beauty”. Then he went after the federal judge, disturbing usually unflappable attorneys around the US, and flustering his supposed allies. The highest ranking Republican in the US, House Speaker Paul Ryan, said “I completely disagree with the thinking” that a judge’s ethnicity should disqualify him or her from a given case, and a conservative law professor warned that such disrespect for courts smacks of “authoritarianism”. Some young Republicans could barely bring themselves to say his name this week, as they unveiled a “playbook” to woo “freedom-loving millennials”.Then Trump went to California, where protesters attacked Trump supporters and the candidate pointed at a solitary African American and shouted: “There! Look at my African American!”Not long afterward Ben Stein, the conservative economist and occasional celebrity, told my colleague Jana Kasperkevic that Trump’s ideas about the economy are “preposterous” and “disastrous”.Plus: “He is not a great businessman.”Rushing to Trump’s defense today will be Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, possible VP pick Newt Gingrich, and foreign relations chair Bob Corker.Rushing to attack him will be Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate for president, and John Podesta, chairman of the Clinton campaign and a diehard believer in UFOs.

Hillary Clinton just took her biggest shot yet at the idea of President Donald Trump.Thursday afternoon, Clinton gave a speech that was billed as a major foreign address. Indeed, the speech was structured as a traditional campaign policy address, with Clinton laying out her ideas and contrasting them with her opponents'.But the speech wasn't really about foreign policy per se. It's about why Donald Trump, the person, is fundamentally unfit to hold the highest office in the land."Donald Trump’s ideas aren’t just different — they are dangerously incoherent," Clinton said at the beginning of the speech. She continued, with a few lines that really cut to the core of the speech:They’re not even really ideas: just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds, and outright lies.  He’s not just unprepared, he’s temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility.  This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes — because it’s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.This wasn't the restrained, diplomatic Clinton we've seen for most of the campaign. This was a full-on firebrand, full of righteous rage at the idea that someone like Donald Trump could possibly be president of the United States.Thursday's speech, then, wasn't a narrow foreign policy address. It was Clinton debuting her fundamental case against Trump — one that hit on exactly what makes so many people so uneasy about Trump's candidacy.Some of the speech was devoted to Clinton outlining her vision for world affairs — strengthen America's economy, work with allies, take the fight to terrorists, and the like. But those aren't really the focus: Her discussion of her own ideas is brief, and her attacks on Trump took up the bulk of the speech.After Clinton briefly summarizes her plan to fight ISIS — intensify the bombing campaign, create a safe zone in Syria — she pivots straight to attacking Trump's claim that he has a "secret" plan to fight ISIS:What's Trump's?  He won't say.  He is literally keeping it a secret.The secret, of course, is he has no idea what he'd do to stop ISIS.Likewise, when she talked about the need to work with allies, she highlighted Trump's proposal to withdraw from our security alliance with Japan if it doesn't start paying the US money and tell the country to get nukes instead:It’s no small thing when he suggests that America should withdraw our military support for Japan, encourage them to get nuclear weapons, and said this about a war between Japan and North Korea – and I quote – "If they do, they do.  Good luck, enjoy yourself, folks."I wonder if he even realizes he’s talking about nuclear war.That language in the last sentence — "I wonder if he even realizes" — is the key to understanding this speech. Clinton's argument, over and over again, is that Trump literally does not understand the policy issues at stake, and thus blithely proposes policies that would end up doing massive harm without even understanding it."He says he doesn’t have to listen to our generals or ambassadors, because he has – quote – 'a very good brain,'" she argued. "He also said, 'I know more about ISIS than the generals do, believe me.'  You know what?  I don’t believe him."This isn't an attack on any one specific policy ideas; as Clinton said at the beginning of the speech, she doesn't see Trump as really having ideas. Rather, it reflects Trump's lack of basic understanding about the way the world works.That's why her attacks went beyond foreign policy, attacking Trump's comments on the debt and deficit as examples of his dangerous ignorance."He believes we can treat the US economy like one of his casinos and default on our debts to the rest of the world, which would cause an economic catastrophe far worse than anything we experienced in 2008," Clinton said. "Those are the words, my friends, of someone who doesn’t understand America or the world."The point here isn't just to attack Trump's ideas, as you would a normal candidate. It's to delegitimize Trump entirely: to say that he lacks even the most basic of basic qualifications to be president of the United States.Theoretically, Trump could rectify his policy ignorance over the course of the campaign. He could study up on foreign policy and reverse his scariest policy positions. Indeed, he has a habit of changing his proposals, sometimes outright lying about what he's said in the past.So Clinton's case against Trump cuts deeper than just highlighting some bad policy ideas. She argues that he is temperamentally incapable of being a good president: that the kind of person he is could never, ever make good decisions as president.This is a point she hammers home toward the end of the speech, when she tries to get the audience to imagine what Trump would be like if he were actually president:Imagine Donald Trump sitting in the Situation Room, making life-or-death decisions on behalf of the United States.  Imagine him deciding whether to send your children into battle.  Imagine if he had not just his Twitter account at his disposal when he’s angry, but America’s entire arsenal.Do we want him making those calls – someone thin-skinned and quick to anger, who lashes out at the smallest criticism?The point here isn't about specific policies, or even comments. It's about the general way Trump has behaved himself: volatile, self-absorbed, thin-skinned. These qualities, Clinton argues, are what give rise to his terrible foreign policy proposals.Clinton takes aim, for example, at Trump's positive comments about dictators in Russia,  China, and North Korea. "He said, 'You’ve got to give Kim Jong Un credit' for taking over North Korea – something he did by murdering everyone he saw as a threat, including his own uncle, which Donald described gleefully, like he was recapping an action movie," she recounts.These aren't just random comments, Clinton says — they are windows into a broken psyche. She more or less literally tells Trump to seek psychiatric help rather than the presidency:I’ll leave it to the psychiatrists to explain his affection for tyrants.  I just wonder how anyone could be so wrong about who America’s real friends are.  But it matters.  Because if you don’t know exactly who you’re dealing with, men like Putin will eat your lunch.This is strong language for a presidential race, and it reflects Clinton's basic strategy of delegitimizing Trump. She's trying to cast him as not just worse than a normal Republican but as a threat to the republic that everyone, on both sides of the aisle, should see as unacceptable.Shorter Hillary: I'm a serious adult who knows things.Trump is a reckless, unhinged know-nothing.What makes this speech so strong — and so much better than the kind of weak attacks the Clinton camp has floated recently — is that Clinton has really put her finger on the reasons people around the country are worried about Trump.It's true that Trump knows nothing about foreign affairs. It's true he has blithely proposed dangerous ideas, like conquering Iraq and stealing its oil. It's true he says bigoted things. It's true he is a volatile person, that he's demonstrated over and over again that he acts wildly based on petty grievances.These are the things that make Trump qualitatively different from any past presidents, who at least had a kind of experience that made them into known and somewhat predictable quantities. They're why Trump has the highest unfavorable ratings of any major party candidate for the presidency, and why the Economist ranks a Trump presidency as one of its top 10 risks to the world this year.Clinton wants to highlight this: to make the core of her message that Trump isn't a normal Republican, but rather someone who's the most dangerous presidential nominee in recent memory. It's a very strong choice.Awesome, share it:By signing up, you agree to our terms.

From railway rollouts to post-war ‘homes for heroes’, history shows us that societies are capable of great and rapid transition in response to a known challenge with clear targets

Energy UK, the trade association representing the big six energy suppliers, has in welcome - if belated - fashion come out in favour of a large-scale shift to low-carbon, renewable energy. Their desire to not be left behind might seem rather academic, as they already have been - both by a warming climate and countries whose embrace of renewable energy is far advanced. Their report on pathways to 2030 is littered with the buzzwords for a more sustainable energy system. It looks at everything from more decentralised energy generation to a “whole systems” approach, energy efficiency and even “reducing energy demand”.Contrary to previous official expectations of rising demand, it expects demand to remain roughly stable, but describes an otherwise substantially changing energy market overseen by uncertain government policies that threaten the investment needed for transformation. Late in 2015 the Department for Energy and Climate Change cut its projection for new renewable energy capacity coming on stream by 2015 by more than one-third from 34 gigawatts (GW) to 22GW. It emerged around the same time that the big six energy suppliers represented by Energy UK had all dropped their green electricity tariffs.Both the big energy companies and government seem to lack any idea of the scale and speed of transition in infrastructure that nations are capable of. Perhaps they need a reminder.Taking a lesson from the dark side, our initial system-wide addiction to fossil fuels was a rapid affair. Starting in 1956 the US Interstate Highway System, for example, managed to build 47,000 miles of highway in just over three decades, “changing commerce and society”. A century earlier, Britain demonstrated the capacity for the rapid rollout of a more benign transport system when just between the years of 1845 and 1852 there were 4,400 miles of railway track laid. A single weekend in 1892 saw the upgrading of 177 miles of track on the Great Western route by 4,200 well-coordinated workers.It is astonishing by the contemporary standards of apparent official impotence to solve the crisis in the housing market (also a key energy issue), that in Britain’s battered and far more indebted post-war condition, the number of homes built annually by local authorities in the early 1950s hit 250,000, and under a Conservative government. Under a Labour government social housing around 1967-68 still saw around 200,000 homes built with the private sector building a similar number, before such ambition fell off a cliff in the 1980s. In comparison, during 2014-15 just 1,350 homes were completed by local authorities in England and the private sector built less than half what it did during the mid 1960s.It is possible to transform societies in response to positive visions of “homes fit for heroes”, but also to mobilise rapidly to fight against the external threats that called for the heroes in the first place. Against significant, official intransigence, from 1936–39 dozens of factories were built or repurposed around Britain as part of a “shadow factories” programme to produce the military hardware for the war effort. And, when they were bombed, as they often were, in great adversity the factories were rapidly repaired and returned to production. Compared to proven historical ability, even the boldest comments of the big energy companies appear tentative and insipid. Recent human migration in response to conflict and other drivers seems to stress our ability to adapt. But forms of large scale adaptation are happening all the time in response to economic and demographic change. It took an estimated 10,000 years for the world’s urban population to add up to 1 billion. Going from 2-3 billion took just 17 years, from 1985–2002. Somehow, however imperfectly and haphazardly, we adapted, responding with urban infrastructures to provide shelter and basic services. What’s needed now is a more conscious, bold and planned programme to achieve the rapid transition of an energy system to respond to a known challenge with clear targets. Denmark, as a small nation, provides in microcosm a classic example. An incentive scheme brought communities and investors together creating both grassroots support and a secure investment environment. In two decades from 1983, 3GW of wind energy capacity were installed. By 2014 wind power was providng 39% of Danish electricity. Internationally things are changing fast. Even in the fossil fuel-hungry US, 8GW of wind were installed in 2015. And in China, for all its problems, nearly 20GW of wind power were introduced in a single year, 2014. Which is more than the UK’s current total installed capacity, onshore and offshore, of wind energy, of just over 14GW.We should applaud the change of tone from Energy UK, but remind them that what makes a real difference finally is: deeds not words.Sign in

         351View  commentsBritain may be facing a schooling crisis over the next few years after claims that there is a 10,000 shortfall in the number of primary places available.The news comes as thousands of parents await letters tomorrow to find out if their children have got a place at their first-choice school, or whether they will have to settle for another.The shortfall is likely to make it even harder to get into any parent's first choice, with hundreds of outstanding schools massively oversubscribed.Britain is facing a schooling crisis over the next few years as it emerged that there is a 10,000 shortfall in the number of primary places available. File imageLast year, one in five students missed out on their chosen school, and new figures show that by 2019-2020, there will be more pupils than places in the south east, the north and the midlands.The Department for Education claims that free schools - independent institutions that were introduced under the Coalition - will make up the numbers, and denies there is any shortfall.But demand is set to rise over the next four years, and many schools have already been extended to to create  new places added since 2010 - and more are needed by 2019.The figures, seen by the Observer newspaper, allegedly show that there have been 300,000 places created since 2010 and 336,000 more are needed by 2019.But a source close to Education Secretary Nicky Morgan claims that the figures are a Labour smear, adding: 'They either made a fundamental miscalculation or they're being deliberately misleading'.The source said that Labour originally claimed the number was 100,000, then downgraded it to 85,000, which was also proven to be untrue.The Department for Education said that data shows that nearly 600,000 additional pupil places were created between May 2010 and May 2015, with many more delivered since then and in the pipeline. Of those, 400,000 were in primary schools, and the rise  follows a decrease of 200,000 primary places between 2004 and 2010.A spokesman added: 'These figures are utter nonsense and based on historic data, meaning thousands of more places have been delivered and planned since, giving families the choice of a good local school.'Since February we’ve allocated £2.7 billion of funding to provide the places needed by the 2019/20 academic year.'The places are reflected in the calculations as they are based on a snapshot at May 2015 - given the lead in time for planning and approving new places, councils will not have been able to factor this investment into their plans.'However, the news comes at a time when the Conservatives' controversial education policy is already under intense scrutiny, being called into question by their own MPs.  The Conservative-led Local Government Association is even expected to directly challenge ministers on how to meet the demand in the face of massive funding cuts, The Guardian reports.Local authorities have a duty to provide school places, but the Government's plan to force all schools to become academies - independent from council control - makes the job all the more challenging.The news comes as thousands of parents await letters tomorrow to find out if their children have got a place at their first-choice school, or whether they will have to settle for another. File imageThe data shows that Bexley, Greenwich, Richmond upon Thames, Sutton and Slough in the south east, Bolton, Manchester, Oldham and Leeds in the north, and Leicester, Birmingham and Walsall in the Midlands, face the biggest shortfalls.Lucinda Yeadon, executive board member for children and families at Leeds city council, compared the situation to 'having both hands tied behind our back', calling it 'totally illogical'.She added: 'We will have to provide yet more places because we are under a legal obligation to do so, but at the same time we will be stripped of the power to do so,' reports The Guardian.Education Secretary Nicky Morgan is currently coming under pressure from her own fellow Conservative MPs over academies proposalsThe official number of places needed was confirmed by the Department for Education, but Labour accused the Governement of covering up the true extent of the crisis, suggesting they shortfall may be as high as 85,000.And critics claim that many of the free schools planned are not in the areas of most need.Tomorrow, an unprecedented numbers of children – up to 80,000 – are expected to miss out on their preferred primary schools this year as the national places crisis intensifies.A baby boom fuelled by migration has left many local authorities at breaking point – and the most over-populated won't be able to offer some families a single place.Experts said the problem could get worse as councils lose powers to create new places because more schools are becoming academies, which are free from local authority control.They also warned of over-crowding in classes and poor facilities as schools struggle to keep pace with the rising birth rate ahead of the allocation letters, which will place 600,000 pupils tomorrow. The news comes as the Conservative government faces serious questions from its own MPs over its academy conversion plan, who expressed major concerns during a Labour-led debate on the issue.Tory backbenchers repeatedly ask Education Secretary Nicky Morgan why the proposals are needed when schools which want to convert already have the power to do so.Tory Steve Brine (Winchester) said he had 'many questions' about the plans.He said: 'If I were to sum up the concerns expressed to me by teachers locally it would be confusion, I think, as to why something that is so obviously not broken needs fixing.'Richard Drax, Conservative MP for South Dorset said that 'one cap fits all always makes me nervous and that a natural progression from one to the other, as has been suggested by other colleagues, is probably the best way to go rather than imposition'.

every time trump loses his temper, imagine him in the situation room making life-or-death decisions on our behalf.

http://www.churchmilitant.com/news/article/department-of-defense-okays-women-on-the-front-lines

WASHINGTON (ChurchMilitant.com) - The U.S. Department of Defense is officially permitting women to serve in all military combat jobs, including front-line units.The historic decision was announced by Secretary of Defense Ash Carter in a Thursday press conference, during which he stated that all branches of the military will have until January 1 to construct a timeline to implement the changes by April 1.The pronouncement opens up around 220,000 jobs currently exclusive to men.  "[A]s long as they qualify and meet the standards, women will now be able to contribute to our mission in ways they could not before," Secretary Carter explained. "They'll be able to drive tanks, give orders, lead infantry soldiers into combat. They'll be able to serve as Army rangers and green berets, Navy SEALS, Marine Corps infantry, Air Force parajumpers and everything else that was previously open only to men."The announcement follows years of review concerning the matter and much public opposition from the Marine Corps, which petitioned to maintain specific positions, including infantry, reconnaissance and fire support, as male-only jobs. However Secretary Carter asserted his choice to apply the policy to all branches, stating that the U.S. military is a "joint force, and I've decided to make a decision that applies to the entire force."  "There will be no exceptions," Carter insisted. The announcement also overrides objections from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, who proposed that certain positions be restricted to men. General Dunford, who had served as Commandant of the Marine Corps and approved their recommendation to limit specific jobs to men, was scheduled to appear alongside Carter during Thursday's announcement, but opted out. According to a senior Obama administration official, the general was "not comfortable" attending the press conference."[T]he chairman didn't feel comfortable having to say he disagreed with his boss," the official explained. Dunford released a statement in which he stated that "in the wake of the secretary's decision, my responsibility is to ensure his decision is properly implemented.""Moving forward, my focus is to lead the full integration of women in a manner that maintains our joint warfighting capability, ensures the health and welfare of our people, and optimizes how we leverage talent across the Joint Force," the general said. Secretary Carter reassured the public that high standards will remain the same, but stressed that "fairness is also important, because everyone who's able and willing to serve their country, who can meet those standards, should have the full and equal opportunity to do so. But the important factor in making my decision was to have access to every American who could add strength to the joint force.""The military has long prided itself on being a meritocracy," he added. The plan to open all combat jobs to women had been in the works since 2013, when then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta revealed a timeline for individual branches to lift the ban that had been in place since 1994. Following Panetta's announcement, branches of the military conducted several evaluations to determine if the policy would be possible to implement. The Panetta decision resulted in around 111,000 jobs being made available to women. Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton praised the decision, saying at a New Hampshire event that "women who are qualified for these positions should be able to compete and win them."Joseph Pelletier is a staff writer for ChurchMilitant.com

ADAMS: I HAVE MADE PART OF MY CAMPAIGN. 11 OUT OF 16 COUNTIES IN THE DISTRICT HAVE LOST CITIZENS, HAVE LOST POPULATION. IF WE TAKE DES MOINES, IOWA, OMAHA, NEBRASKA, AND KANSAS TRIANGLE OF OPPORTUNITY. BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS AT REASONABLE COST, FOLKS COULD BECOME REMOTE EMPLOYEES TO ONE OF THESE MAJOR HUBS WHICH WOULD PUT FOOD AND BREAD ON THE TABLE. THAT IS A BIPARTISAN OPPORTUNITY THAT I'VE HEARD BOTH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS REALLY EMBRACE. IT LAYS THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO RECRUIT BUSINESSES AND ENTREPRENEURS. INDIVIDUAL HAS TO PAY $200 A MONTH BUT THEY CAN'T EVEN LIVE STREAM, WHICH MEANS THEY CAN'T PARTICIPATE IN FINDING THEIR CATTLE FEED. KATHIE: THE STATE HAS TRIED TO ADDRESS THIS IN BUILDING OUT TO AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE BROADBAND. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THIS. HAVEN'T DONE THE JOB? MR. ADAMS: I'M COMMITTED TO IT, NUMBER ONE. I MAY VOICE FOR THE FOLKS IN RURAL IOWA. IT IS FROM THE CURB TO THE DOOR, THAT LAST MILE. I BELIEVE WE CAN HAVE A FEDERAL, STATE, AND PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP TO HELP THOSE INDIVIDUALS. THE REALITY IS THIS. IF YOU LAY WIRE DOWN FOR BROADBAND INTERNET IN AN URBAN COMMUNITY OR IN A RURAL COMMUNITY, YOU ONLY HAVE TWO HOMES EVERY TWO MILES, SOME OF THESE SMALL PLACES ARE NOT GETTING IT BACK. YOU. STACEY: MR. SHERZAN, IN ONE OF YOUR CAMPAIGN ADS, THE VOICEOVER SAYS WOMEN IN YOUR COMPANY WERE PAID FAIRLY. AND WHEN YOU GO TO CONGRESS, YOU'LL FIGHT FOR EQUAL PAY. THE AD DOESN'T SAY WOMEN IN YOUR COMPANY WERE PAID EQUALLY? MR. SHERZA FAIRLY IS EQUALLY. EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK. THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IN THIS IT IS NOT VERIFIABLE. I CAN'T REMEMBER ANY TIME IN MY LIFE WHERE TWO EMPLOYEES WOULD SAY, WHAT IS YOUR SALARY, AND WHAT IS MY SALARY, AND THEY COMPARE TO SEE IF THEY ARE BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. WE DON'T HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO TREATMENT. SAME WORKLOAD, THE SAME JOB DESCRIPTION, THE SAME FUNCTION, SHOULD BE PAID EQUALLY. THAT IS WHY ALL THOSE EMPLOYEES IN THAT AD WERE DOING IT, THEM. KATHIE: MR. MOWRER, YOU'RE ALONE IN THIS RACE IN YOUR PAST SUPPORT OF THE KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE, WHICH IS NOT POPULAR AMONG DEMOCRATS. YOU ALSO HAVE NOT EXPRESSED GENERAL OPPOSITION TO THE USE EMINENT DOMAIN, TAKING PRIVATE PRIVATE BUSINESS. WHY HAVE YOU TAKEN THESE POSITIONS AND WHAT SHOULD DEMOCRATS KNOW ABOUT YOUR INTENTIONS FOR FUTURE PROJECTS? CLEAN ENERGY INCHER. CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL. THE SCIENCE IS IN. WE HAVE AN EXPANDING CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY. WE HAVE 30% OF OUR ELECTRICITY COMING FROM WIND. WE HAVE A $3.5 BILLION INVESTMENT IN CLEAN ENERGY. IN THE PENTAGON, I INITIATED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER WHICH INITIATED A CUT IN ENERGY USE. I HAVE A RECORD OF RESULTS IN IMPLEMENTING POLICY. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FUTURE OF WHAT WE HAVE TO DO TO GET TO THAT FULLY CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY, THAT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT PROPOSED CONSTRUCTION OF CLEAN ENERGY TRANSFER LINES, EMINENT DOMAIN MAY NEED TO BE USED. TO COMPLETELY THROW EMINENT DOMAIN OUT FOR THE FUTURE USE WHEN IT COMES TO CLEAN ENERGY I THINK WOULD BE SHORTSIGHTED. KATHIE: I DIDN'T HEAR YOU SAY PIPELINE IN THE FIRST PLACE. MR. MOWRER: THERE WAS A STUDY AND I WAS BASING IT ON THOSE SAID THIS WOULD NOT PRODUCE A LONG-TERM NEGATIVE IMPACT. IMMIGRATION. YOU. YOU ALL SUPPORT A PATHWAY TO LEGALIZATION FOR THE ESTIMATED 11 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS LIVING IN THE U.S. IS THERE A COMPROMISE TO BE MADE WITH REPUBLICANS, SECURE THE BORDER FIRST, THEN WORK ON AN IMMIGRATION DEAL MR. ADAMS, WE BEGIN WITH YOU. MR. ADAMS: I AM IN FAVOR OF FULL COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM, BUT I DON'T SEE NEGOTIATING THE BUILDING OF A WALL, AND THAT THE BUILDING OF A WALL IS GOING TO FURTHER OUR DEMOCRACY, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. LAWS IN OUR COUNTRY. WE DO IN REGARDS TO THAT. I DON'T BELIEVE BUILDING A WALL COALITION BETWEEN US AND CITIZENS OR UNDOCUMENTED COUNTRY. COMING TO AMERICA. THAT REASON, WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND. WE HAVE A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY. SOME PEOPLE ARE IN TREMENDOUSLY BAD SITUATIONS BECAUSE OF GANG WARFARE, TRAFFICKING, BUT WE HAVE TO BE OPEN TO ALL CITIZENS. WE ARE A LAND OF IMMIGRANTS. WALL. SHERZAN, WHERE IS THE COMPROMISE WITH REPUBLICANS? MR. SHERZAN: I NEVER SAY ABSOLUTELY NOT COMPROMISE. LEGISLATION, WORKING IN CONGRESS IS THE ART OF COMPROMISE. THE WAY IT IS BEING ADDRESSED RIGHT NOW, PARTICULARLY ON THE PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL WITH MR. DISGRACE. I REMEMBER A TIME IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE WE THOUGHT ABOUT EUROPE AND EASTERN EUROPE AND A WALL THAT EXISTED THERE, HOW WE WAR. OUR COUNTRY IS BETTER THAN THAT. THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO STAY IN OUR COUNTRY, OBVIOUSLY IT HAS BEEN A STRUGGLE FOR THEM. I'M VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF THE DREAM ACT TO HELP THE YOUNGER PEOPLE STAY IN THIS COUNTRY AND EARN CITIZENSHIP. I ALSO AM VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF REFORM. BUT BUILDING A WALL IS INSANE. IT. WE DID DURING THE COLD WAR AND THAT WAS THE RIGHT INCLUDED. STACEY: MR. MOWRER, WHERE ARE YOU ON THIS? MR. MOWRER: ONE OF MY PROUDEST I WAS SERVING IN IRAQ. I HAD A SOLDIER IN A UNIT WHO HAD BEEN BORN IN MEXICO. WE WENT THROUGH AN EXPEDITED PROCESS TO GET HIS CITIZENSHIP. I WAS PROUD TO STAND WITH HIM. AND DIVISIVE LANGUAGE, THAT IS WHAT I THINK OF. IMMIGRATION REFORM. THERE WAS A BILL THAT PASSED THE SENATE WITH 76 VOTES. THAT INCLUDED A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP. BORDER PROTECTIONS. GOVERNOR PERRY OF TEXAS SAID PEOPLE WHO ADVOCATE FOR BUILDING A WALL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT BORDER SECURITY, THAT IS PART OF IMMIGRATION REFORM, BUT I ALSO CITIZENSHIP. DAVID YOUNG HAS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION, WHETHER HE SUPPORTS DONALD TRUMP'S SPECIAL TASK DEPORTED. THANK YOU. KATHIE: MR. SHERZAN, THIS NEXT BOTH OF YOUR OPPONENTS HAVE SIGNIFICANT COMMUNITY SERVICE IN THEIR BACKGROUNDS, INCLUDING MR. MOWRER'S MILITARY SERVICE AND MR. ADAMS COMMUNITY ACTIVISM AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. BESIDES BUILDING A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS AND TREATING YOUR EMPLOYEES WELL, WHAT HAVE YOU , EITHER WITH YOUR TIME OR RESOURCES? MR. SHERZAN: IN THE 1990'S, I WAS WORKING FOR THE CITY COUNCIL, TRYING TO UNDERSTAND ISSUES RELATED TO THE AIRPORT. WE WERE TRYING TO GET AIRLINES TO COME INTO THIS. WE HAPPENED TO BE A CITY. ULTIMATELY THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL. IN ADDITION TO THAT, I HAPPEN TO BE WORKING WITH MY CHURCH AND FINANCE COUNCIL AT THE CHURCH THAT I WENT TO. I WAS PART OF AN ORGANIZATION BY THE NAME OF IOWA COUNCIL FOR INTERNATIONAL UNDERSTANDING WITH VISITORS FROM EUROPE AND ASIA. I WORKED WITH THEM TO GET THEM ACCLIMATED TO WHAT WE DO IN IOWA IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, SECURITIES AND INSURANCE INDUSTRY. DURING THAT TIME. ABOUT EVERY BASEBALL GAME IN FOOTBALL GAME AND EVERY OTHER SPORT I COULD COACH, AND MEET WITH MY FAMILY, THAT I COULD STARE, WAS WHAT I DID. STACEY: THANK YOU. MR. MOWRER, YOU HAVE SERVED IN THE ARMED FORCES AND REPRESENTED THE ARMY IN CIVILIAN SERVICE BUT IT'S DIFFICULT TO FIND WHAT JOBS YOU HAVE HELD SINCE, BESIDE DISTRICTS. ARE YOU A PROFESSIONAL CANDIDATE? MYSELF TO PUBLIC SERVICE AND I MIGHT BE THE POOREST MEMBER OF CONGRESS BECAUSE OF IT. I SERVE IN THE MILITARY. I'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK WITH VETERANS ISSUES. I WORKED FOR JOE BIDEN, DOING VETERANS POLICY. CIVILIAN. I HAVE A BROAD RANGE OF SERVICE. FIGHTING THOSE FIGHTS WE NEED TO TAKE ON, INCLUDING FIGHTING FOR OUR PROGRESSIVE VALUES, WORKING TASKS. STACEY: ALONG THE SAME LINES, YOU HAVE SAID YOU MOVED TO DES MOINES FOR FAMILY AND MEDICAL REASONS, ESPECIALLY FOR YOUR SON. CRITICS SAY YOU RELOCATED FROM ONE DISTRICT TO ANOTHER TO ALS RUN FOR CONGRESS AGAIN. THEY SAY YOU ARE A CARPET HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT? SOMETHING CRITICS WOULD SAY. FOR NEARLY A DECADE. THE ONLY TIME I LIVED OUTSIDE OF IOWA WAS WHEN I SERVED IN IRAQ IN THE PENTAGON WITH THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. IOWA. OF DES MOINES. AT STAKE. I'M NOT WILLING TO SIT ON THE ADDRESS THOSE. STACEY: THANK YOU. UP, YOU SAID THIS PRIMARY ELECTION IS NOT ABOUT THE ISSUES. IF NOT ABOUT THE ISSUES, WHAT IS THIS ABOUT? MR. ADAMS: IF IT WAS ABOUT THE ISSUES, YOU WOULD SEE THAT ALL DIFFERENCE ON THE ISSUES. WE ALL AGREE ON CLEAN AIR, CLEAN WATER, CLEAN GROUND. WE AGREE ON COMPLETE SO FAR. YOU DON'T SEE A DIVISIVE NEST OTHER THAN THAT ONE GENTLEMAN AND THE OTHERS DON'T. PROGRESSIVE ISSUES. DAVID YOUNG. IN ORDER TO UNSEAT DAVID YOUNG, COALITIONS TO DO THAT. ONE OTHER THING I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION, SINCE MY OPPONENT THE ART OF COMPROMISE. WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING A WALL AND TALKING ABOUT UNDOCUMENTED CITIZENS IN THIS COUNTRY, I'M NOT GOING TO COMPROMISE ON WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS SAYING HE WANTS AMERICA. STACEY: MR. MOWRER SMILING WHEN MR. ADAMS SAID YOU ALL AGREED. DID YOU HAVE A RESPONSE? MR. MOWRER: I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES THAT SET US APART, WHO STANDS WITH US. THERE'S A REASON I HAVE OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FROM GRASSROOTS ACTIVISTS. FEDERATION OF LABOR. I'VE BEEN ENDORSED BY THE THREE PAST CHAIRS OF THE IOWA DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THESE FOLKS BELIEVE IN ME AND TRUST IN ME. THEY'VE SEEN WHAT I'VE DONE. MR. SHERZAN? MR. SHERZAN: WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS SEVERAL TIMES. ENDORSEMENTS ARE VERY IMPORTANT. I SEEK ENDORSEMENTS AS WELL, BUT ENDORSEMENTS ARE ONLY ONE VOTE. IF YOU DON'T LIVE IN THE DISTRICT, THEY ARE NOT EVEN WORTH THAT. TO VOTE FOR. THEY ARE CITIZENS. THEY MAKE UP THEIR OWN MINDS. IF ENDORSEMENTS WERE ALL THAT WERE NEEDED, THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE THAT GOT THE MOST ENDORSEMENTS IN IOWA, HIS NAME HAPPENED TO THE MARTIN O'MALLEY. MR. MOWRER: THE LABOR UNIONS THAT ENDORSED ME REPRESENT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF VOTERS. MONTHS AFTER. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ENDORSEMENTS, WELL. WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. KATHIE: WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO SQUEEZE ONE MORE QUESTION IN HERE. MR. SHERZAN, WHAT PRIORITY WOULD YOU PUT ON ADDRESSING GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE COMPARED TO OTHER ISSUES SUCH AS WAGE INEQUALITY AND IMPROVING INFRASTRUCTURE? WHAT SPECIFIC STEPS SHOULD THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUIRE? REAL. I'M A FACT-BASED SCIENTIFIC-BASED DECISION-MAKER AND THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL AND IT IS AFFECTING OUR COUNTRY, THE WORLD, OUR AGRICULTURE, SO IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. I HAVE SEVERAL PRIORITIES. THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE TOP TO ADDRESS. THROUGH HIS PLAN IS DEFINITELY SEEKING TO LIMIT CARBON EMISSIONS. PLAN. IT IS A LONG-TERM PLAN. THE BOTTOM LINE IS IF WE DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT IS ALL THESE OTHER ISSUES ARE GOING TO BE NEGATED. WE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE STORMS THAT ARE OUT OF CONTROL. WE ARE GOING TO SEE THINGS AFFECT OUR ECONOMY DRAMATICALLY. KATHIE: MR. MOWRER, YOU MENTIONED RENEWABLES. WHAT PRIORITY DO YOU PUT ON ADDRESSING GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE REQUIRED? MR. MOWRER: CLIMATE CHANGE IS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT AND THE PENTAGON HAVE LISTED CLIMATE CHANGE AS ONE OF THE TOP, IF NOT THE TOP THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY AND ECONOMIC STABILITY. IT LITERALLY IS THE TOP PRIORITY BECAUSE IT IS A THREAT TO OUR PEOPLE. I SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT'S CLEAN POWER PLAN, WHICH TAKE STEPS TO LIMIT EMISSIONS. DAVID YOUNG HAS TOUTED HIS OPPOSITION TO THESE THINGS AND RECENTLY TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH HE OPPOSED SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES TO THE EPA. DAVID YOUNG HAS THE LOWEST REPRESENTATIVES IN IOWA. ACTION FROM DAVID RUN. KATHIE: MR. ADAMS? MR. ADAMS: I THINK IT IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, FOR OUR COUNTRY. I'M NOT NECESSARILY CERTAIN THAT I CAN RECONCILE THAT WITH WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE THIRD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT THAT I'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT. BUT WE NEED TO DO BETTER TO REMOVE OUR GREENHOUSE GASES. WE HAVE TO USE OUR INNOVATION TO DO BETTER. MOBILIZATION ACT. A PLEDGE, EXCUSE ME, WHERE I AM CONGRESS, I'M GOING TO GET US TO GREENHOUSE FREE. I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER. I THINK THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO TO PROTECT OUR LAND AND WATER US. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE, WE ARE AN ACTOR IN THAT. DOING. THAT WHAT THEY SAID WAS INCORRECT. BACK THEN. RESPONSIBLE. STACEY LET'S MOVE ON TO RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. COMMUNITIES FIGHT OVER A VETERAN'S MEMORIAL FEATURING A CROSS PLACED ON PUBLIC LAN MR. MOWRER, WHERE IS THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE AND PROTECTING AMERICANS' RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS? MR. MOWRER: I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT EXHIBIT LIKE WE'RE SEEING ON THE SCREEN, THOSE ARE THINGS THAT DO NOT VIOLATE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM SEPARATION. STACEY: MR. ADAMS? MR. ADAM THIS IS A REAL TOUCHY SUBJECT. UNFORTUNATELY, WE POLITICIZE OUR RELIGIOUS FERVOR. ON OUR TEAM, WE HAVE JEWISH, ISLAMIC, CHRISTIAN -- I MYSELF AM A CHRISTIAN, AND WE HAVE FOLKS OF AGNOSTIC, INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE NO RELIGION. TO PAY TAX DOLLARS, YOU HAVE A VOICE AT THAT TABLE AS WELL. THERE TENDS TO BE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY LIKES TO POLITICIZE AND OWN GOD. PARTY OWNS GOD. THAT. AS A MAN THAT BECAME BAPTIZED IN HIS LATER YEARS, I BELIEVE WE SHOULD OPEN THAT DOOR AND BE OPEN TO EVERYONE AND FOLLOW AFTER THE GOOD LOOK AND OTHER BOOKS THAT THEY READ. STACEY: THERE ARE SOME BUSINESS OWNERS IN IOWA WHERE THEY CLAIM DOING BUSINESS WITH SOMEBODY THAT DOES NOT FOLLOW THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEF VIOLATES THEIR RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS. WHERE ARE YOU ON THAT? MR. ADAMS: WE HAD THAT SAME ARGUMENT 40, 50 YEARS AGO WHEN AFRICAN-AMERICANS WOULD TRY TO SEE THAT SOMEONE'S COUNTER. WHAT THE KU KLUX KLAN THAT FLEW THE FLAG OF CHRISTIANITY AND BURNED CROSSES TALKING ABOUT THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. AT SOME POINT, WE HAVE TO OUR COUNTRY. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE HAVE TO KOWTOW TO THAT EXTREMISM. THEIR POSITIONS ON. AT THE SAME TIME, WE HAVE TO BE A LAND OF ALL. STACEY: MR. SHERZAN, WHERE DO YOU BALANCE THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE AND PROTECTING AMERICANS' FREEDOM? MR. SHERZAN: IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL STATEMENT THAT OUR COUNTRY IS AND STATE. DISCRIMINATION. BUSINESS OWNERS WHO WANT TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM UTILIZING THEIR SERVICES BECAUSE THEY HAPPEN TO DISAGREE FROM A RELIGIOUS PERSPECTIVE, I THINK THE ISSUE OF DISCRIMINATION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT. I BELIEVE ALSO THAT WHEN YOU COME TO ISSUES LIKE YOU SHOWED ON THE SCREEN THAT THERE IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCE IN EVERY UNIQUE SITUATION AND THAT ULTIMATELY HAS TO BE DECIDED LIKE MANY TIMES IT HAS BEEN, IN COURT. HOWEVER, IF I HAVE TO COME DOWN THE SIDE OF SEPARATION. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT UTILIZING RELIGIOUS EMBLEMS ON PUBLIC PROPERTY, THAT IS WHERE THE ISSUE COMES ABOUT. WE ARE A COUNTRY BUILT ON THAT RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. STACEY: ARE YOU SAYING THAT MEMORIAL NEEDS TO GO, YES OR NO? MR. SHERZAN: I DON'T BELIEV THAT, QUITE FRANKLY. I THINK THE COURT SYSTEM SHOULD STACEY: THANK YOU. OUR DEBATE IS JUST GETTING STACEY WELCOME BACK TO OUR DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY DEBATE WITH CANDIDATES FOR IOWA'S 3RD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT. KCCI'S CHIEF POLITICAL REPORTER CYNTHIA FODOR JOINS US. CYNTHIA: STACEY AND KATHIE, WE ASKED VIEWERS AND READERS TO SUBMIT THEIR QUESTIONS FOR THE CANDIDATES USING TWITTER AND EMAI WE WANT TO START WITH THIS ONE. OUR FIRST QUESTION COMES FROM IF ELECTED, WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO HELP IOWA STUDENTS WITH STUDENT DEBT MR. ADAMS, WE START WITH YOU. YOU SAID THIS HITS CLOSE TO HOME MR. ADAMS: ABSOLUTELY. DEBT. UNIVERSITY. WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS AND THE CHALLENGES THAT EXIST. I BELIEVE WE SHOULD HAVE THE FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN RATE. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT AT A BANK RATE, SOMEWHERE AROUND 3% IF NOT LOWER. I DON'T BELIEVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE PROFITEERING OFF THE BACKS OF THE STUDENTS THAT ARE GOING TO ADD VALUE TO OUR COUNTRY. I SUPPORT YOUR EFFORTS. IF I GET TO WASHINGTON, D.C., THAT IS A CRITICAL ISSUE. PLACING ON OUR STUDENTS. CYNTHIA: MR. SHERZAN? TALKING ABOUT THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. ONE POINT I HEARD FROM MR. TRUMP IS, I LIKE THE UN-EDUCATED. OWA DOESN'T LI EDUCATED PEOPLE. REFINANCE. NUMBER TWO, WE SHOULD MAKE TUITION TAX-DEDUCTIBLE. NUMBER THREE, WE SHOULD ALLOW THEM TO NOT GO INTO LOANS AT SUCH HIGH RATES. AND NOT BE ABLE TO REFINANCE. ALL THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE TRYING TO DO IS BETTER THEIR LIVES AND THEIR FAMILIES LIVES. AS A SOCIETY, WHAT DO WE WANT TO DO WITH OUR RESOURCES? THAT IS IMPORTANT. PEOPLE TRYING TO BETTER THEIR FAMILIES, IMPROVE THEIR PRIORITY. CYNTHIA: MR. MOWRER? MR. MOWRER I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH USING THE G.I. BILL. I DID WORK TO EXPAND INTO THE POST 9/11 G.I. BILL AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT DAVID YOUNG COSPONSORED LEGISLATION TO MAKE CUTS TO THE POST-9/11 G.I. BILL. I THINK THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS. MY WIFE DOES HAVE SEVERAL STUDENT LOANS STILL. I SUPPORT SENATOR WARRENSVILLE REFINANCE THOSE. PRESIDENT'S INITIATIVE. I BELIEVE WE SHOULD HAVE A PUBLIC SERVICE OPTION. EVERYONE. EITHER A PRECOLLEGE OR POSTCOLLEGE OPTION FOR EVERYONE TO BE INVESTED IN THE COUNTRY WOULD BE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO HELP PEOPLE PAY DOWN THAT DO THAT AS WELL. CYNTHIA: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM SHARY ALBAUGH. SHE WANTS TO KNOW. WOULD ANY OF YOU CONSIDER RUNNING FOR ONE TERM ONLY? AND IF NOT, WOULD YOU CONSIDER LIMITING THE NUMBER OF TERMS YOU SERV MR. SHERZAN, WE START WITH YOU. QUESTION. I'M VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF A CONSIDERATION OF THAT. I THINK INDIVIDUALS THAT SERVE A LIFETIME IN CONGRESS, IN MIND INTEREST. WE HAVE A TERM LIMIT ON THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I WOULD BE OPEN TO CONSIDERATIONS SUCH AS TERM LIMITS ON THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE, POSSIBL TWO-TERMS FOR TERMS FOR THE HOUSE. TH SAID, REALLY, THE HOUSE IS THE PEOPLE. LOT. BUT WHAT I DO NOT BELIEVE IN IS A LIFELONG CAREER POLITICIAN TAKING THOSE ROLES AND THINKING THEY ARE ENTITLED TO IT. THAT IS NOT THE WAY IT SHOULD BE. CYNTHIA: MR. MOWRER. MR. MOWRER: I THINK ELECTIONS ARE TERM LIMITS. YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE EXPERT LEGISLATORS WE'VE HAD, PEOPLE LIKE TOM HARKIN, I WOULDN'T WANT TO LIMIT HIS TERM. BUT THERE ARE THINGS THAT GIVE INCUMBENTS AN UNFA ADVANTAGE, FINANCE SYSTEM. FINANCE REFORM, OVERTURNED CITIZENS UNITED, AND WE NEED TO END GERRYMANDERING. I THINK AT TIMES, WE ABSOLUTELY NEED LAWMAKERS WHO HAVE EXPERTISE. WHEN I WAS SERVING IN THE PENTAGON, CARL LEVIN FROM MICHIGAN WAS THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE. HE KNEW EVERY INCH OF THE PENTAGON BUDGET. WORK. HE PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN OVERSIGHT AND CREATING GREAT LEGISLATION. IS VERY IMPORTANT. CYNTHIA: MR. ADAMS? MR. ADAMS: I WOULD CONSIDER IT. I'M NOT NECESSARILY CERTAIN THAT WOULD ACHIEVE THE END RESULT, WHICH IS PROBABLY THE QUESTION, HOW OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM HAS GOT TO A SYSTEM OF PARTISAN GRIDLOCK. REFORM IS INVOLVED IN THAT. UNFORTUNATELY, WE CANNOT HAVE THE EVERYDAY CITIZEN, IF YOU ARE NOT BORN INTO WEALTH OR YOU DON'T KNOW MILLIONAIRES OR BILLIONAIRES, YOU MIGHT NOT BE OFFICE. TALENT ON THE SIDELINES. IT KEEPS OUR COUNTRY IN THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL WE'VE BEEN IN. WORKS. TODAY WE HAVE A CONGRESSMAN THAT IS NOT WORKING FOR THE CITIZENS OF HIS OWN CONGRESSIONAL WASHINGTON FOR DECADES. HE'S PART OF THIS PROBLEM. I WOULD CONSIDER IT. MANY OF YOU BROUGHT UP CAMPAIGN FINANCE, SO WHILE WE A 60 MINUTES REPORT, CONGRESSMEN CAN SPEND 30 HOURS A WEEK RAISING MONEY FOR THEIR POLITICAL PARTIES AT CALL CENTERS JUST BLOCKS AWAY FROM THE CAPITOL BUILDING. WOULD YOU TAKE A STAND RIGHT NOW AND SAY YOU WON'T SPEND THAT MUCH TIME ASKING FOR MONEY MR. MOWRER: 30 HOURS A WEEK? I DON'T PLAN ON SPENDING 30 HOURS A WEEK. CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM WHICH MEANS WE HAVE A SUPREME COURT UNITED. I HAVE SUPPORTED PIECES OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM WHICH MEANS MATCHING FUNDS LIMITING, BUT WE REALLY NEED TO GET RID OF THIS DARK MONEY, THE SUPER PACS. IF YOU LOOK AT DAVID YOUNG'S REPORTS, HIS CAMPAIGN IS FUNDED COMMITTEES. THAT HAS A CORRUPTIVE ROLE IN POLITICS. STACEY: WOULD YOU SUPPORT THE FEDERAL-ELECTED OFFICIALS FROM DIRECTLY SOLICITING DONATIONS. MR. MOWRER: I THINK THE STOP ACT IS SHORTSIGHTED, SO I WOULD NOT. STACEY MR. ADAMS, WOULD YOU SPEND 30 HOURS A WEEK AT ONE OF FOR YOUR PARTY? MR. ADAMS: OUT OF THE THREE CANDIDATES THAT ARE UP HERE, MY MONEY. THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE I DON'T MY CAMPAIGN ON WHAT WE HAVE NOT DONE AS A DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN THE LAST COUPLE OF CYCLES, BUILDING THE COALITIONS NECESSARY TO UNSEAT DAVID YOUNG. IT IS NOT SIMPLY RAISING MONEY. WE HAD A CANDIDATE IN 2014 THAT RAISED $2.7 MILLION. THAN DAVID YOUNG. 29,000 VOTES. MONEY. I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO DO BETTER DO BETTER IN UNDERSTANDING THE NEEDS AND CONCERNS, THE HOAX, THE DREAMS, AND THE INSPIRING OF THE CITIZENS OF THE DISTRICT. MESSAGE OUT. MR. ADAMS: AT THE SAME TIME, SO AND GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION. STACEY: MR. SHERZAN, WILL YOU SPEND 30 HOURS A WEEK DIALING PARTY? TERM PERFECT. ALL THREE OF US HAVE DIFFERENT INVOLVED IN CAMPAIGNING. SPEND TIME IN A COLD ROOM OF THEIR OWN, TRYING TO CONVINCE PEOPLE BOTH IN-STATE AND OUT-OF-STATE TO GET ELECTED. COMPREHENSIVE REFORM IN CAMPAIGN FINANCIN, PLACING MONEY IN CAMPAIGNS IN THE QUANTITIES THAT SUPER PACS -- THEY DON'T DO IT CANDIDATES. THEY CAN GET RESULTS. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, I'M IN COMPETITIVE. I HAVE CONTRIBUTED QUITE A BIT TO MY OWN CAMPAIGN AND I DO THAT BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. CITIZENS UNITED IS A TRAVESTY AND IT DOESN'T REFLECT THE QUALITIES OF OUR NATION. STACEY: WOULD YOU SUPPORT THE STOP ACT THAT WOUL BAN FEDERAL SOLICITING DONATIONS? MR. SHERZAN: WITH ONE CAVEAT. PHILOSOPHICALLY, THE STOP ACT IS IN LINE WITH MY PRINCIPLES, BUT ENOUGH. IF YOU CAN'T GE PAC MONEY OUT OF POLITIC JUST NOT ALLOWING ME TO MAKE PHONE CALLS THAT SOME PARTY LEADER WANTS ME TO MAKE IS NOT GOING TO PREVENT THE DOLLARS. YOU HAVE TO FIND A WAY WHERE BOTH PARTIES TAKE CORPORATE OUT OF THE SYSTEM. THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT WORK. STACEY: THANK YOU. MR. SHERZAN, YOU CAN HAVE A MR. ADAMS. MR. ADAMS: I DON'T BELIEVE THE ACT GOES FAR ENOUGH. DO BELIEVE THAT IF WE COULD, HAVING CAMPAIGNS PUBLICLY FINANCED WOULD BE INCREDIBLE. THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO BRING THE WEALTH OF TALENT TO THE FOREFRONT ON BEHALF OF THE CITIZENS. I THINK THAT FROM THAT DARK MONEY. NEEDS TO BE WE NEED A CONSTITUTIONAL TRANSPARENCY. STACEY: MR. MOWRER. MR. MOWRER MY CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN DONORS. I THINK IT IS VERY CONVENIENT THAT MIKE SAYS HE WANTS TO TAKE THE MONEY OUT OF CAMPAIGNS, BECAUSE HE HAS CONTRIBUTED OVER CAMPAIGN. I DON'T THINK CONGRESSIONAL EITHER. STACEY: MR. SHERZAN, A BRIEF RESPONSE. MR. SHERZAN: YOU AND I AGREED NOT TO ATTACK EACH OTHER, BUT ME. I WOULD REQUEST THAT THE CITIZENS, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GO TO THE FEDERAL ELECTIONS COMMISSION AND LOOK AT WHO IS CONTRIBUTING TO WHOM. I'M CONTRIBUTING TO MY OWN CAMPAIGN BECAUSE I'M PROUD OF THE HISTORY AND SUPPORT I HAVE. MONEY IS COMING FROM. YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THAT MONEY COMES FROM A FIRM -- YOU ARE ACTUALLY GETTING MORE AM. CASTIN DISPERSIONS ON MY CHARACTER AND MY CAMPAIGN IS NOT SOMETHING I AGREE WITH. STACEY: ONE MORE BRIEF RESPONSE. MR. MOWRER 95% OF MIKE'S MONEY HAS COME FROM THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. TO SAY I HAVE MORE MONEY COMING FROM PEOPLE IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICE INDUSTRY IS SILLY. KATHIE: MR. TO ANOTHER TOPIC. IOWA SEN. JONI ERNST HAS WORKED WITH DEMOCRAT CLAIRE MCCASKILL ON LEGISLATION TO PROTECT THOSE WHO REPORT SEXUAL ASSAULT IN THE MILITARY. BUT THE ISSUE OF WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE OFFENDERS IS STILL CONTROVERSIAL. DO YOU BELIEVE ASSAULT INVESTIGATIONS SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE CHAIN OF COMMAND? WHAT WOULD YOU PROPOSE TO PREVENT MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY FROM BEING VICTIMIZE MR. ADAM WE NEED TO RESPECT OUR WOMEN. THE REALITY IS, THIS WOULDN'T PLACE. UNFORTUNATELY, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOLDIERS WHO HAVE TO FOLLOW THEIR COMMAND. WHEN THEY ARE IN A SITUATION, WHEN THEY HAVE NO VOICE OR THEY RUN UP AGAINST DISCRIMINATION TO DO? TODAY, THEY ARE NOT HEARD. I HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL ON MY TEAM WHO IS A VETERAN, HEATHER RYAN. ARE VETERANS. I HONOR JIM'S SERVICE. HE IS A PATRIOT. I HONOR THOSE LIKE HEATHER. BUT WE HAVE TO DO BETTER AND RESPECT OUR WOMEN AND MAKE SURE THEY HAVE A VOICE SO WHEN THEY COMMAND STRUCTURE MIGHT NOT SUPPORT THERE I THAT THEY HAVE A PLACE TO GO TO. MR. SHERZAN: MR. SHERZAN, WHAT ABOUT THE OFFENDERS? MR. SHERZA FIVE BELIEVE IT HAS COMMAND. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT A SYSTEM THAT HAS NOT WORKED IN THE PAST. IT HAS NOT POLICED ITSELF. SYSTEM, IT ISN'T WORKING. OUT OF THE SYSTEM. KATHIE: MR. MOWRER, YOU HAD MILITARY. HAVE YOU EVER HAD TO DEAL WITH A COMPLAINT OF SEXUAL ASSAULT? SEEN THE PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE. I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THERE'S MORE MA VICTIMS OF THAN FEMALE. THIS AFFECTS MALE SOLDIERS AND SERVICE MEMBERS AS WELL. I DID TAKE THE UNPOPULAR TAKEN OUTSIDE THE CHAIN OF COMMAND. WE'VE TRIED IN THE OTHER WAY. CONFLICT OF INTEREST. WE NEED TO REFORM. I WOULD SUPPORT LEGISLATION TO DO THAT. STACEY: HOW DOES YOUR APPROACH TO COMBATING ISIS DIFFER FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA'S, MR. ADAMS? MR. ADAMS: I DON'T HAVE A BACKGROUND IN THE MILITARY. THE MILITARY. I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO THEM. LIFE. ALLIES. INTEREST. TROOPS. BUT I AM A MAN OF PEACE. BUT BEING A MAN OF PEACE DOESN'T MEAN I WILL NOT VOTE TO PROTECT OUR ALLIES. ISIS. WE NEED TO REMOVE THEM FROM THE BATTLE YIELD IN SHORT ORDER. STACEY: MR. SHERZAN, HOW DOES FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA'S? COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. CHIEF. MY POSITION IN CONGRESS WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF WHAT I BE CARRIED FORWARD. I THINK HISTORICALLY THE MILITARY, WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN A THAN ISIS. RESPOND. WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN THE STRONGEST MILITARY IN THE WORLD. THERE'S ANOTHER ASPECT. THEY ARE NOT ONLY ATTACKING US DIRECTLY IN VARIOUS THEATERS. THEY ARE UTILIZING MODERN TECHNOLOGY, COMMUNICATION. OR THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO. WE HAVE TO BE SMARTER THAN THEM. THE PRESIDENT IS SUCCEEDING IN DIMINISHING THEIR ABILITY TO ATTACK US. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THEY ARE RECRUITING AND WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT THROUGH THE VIRTUAL SYSTEM THEY ARE USING. STACEY: MR. MOWRER? MR. MOWRER: RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE LOWEST PERCENTAGE OF VETERANS IN CONGRESS THAN AT ANY POINT IN OUR NATIONS HISTORY. UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN T SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT IN THIS EFFORT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE SITUATION ON THE GROUND. AD REGIME, ISIS, THE KURDS, TURKEY ETC., AND WE ARE HELPING THE IRAQI SECURITY FORCES WHO ARE ON THE OFFENSIVE. BUT WE HAVE TO USE ALL THE TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSAL. THE ABSOLUTELY WRONG APPROACH THAT SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE LIKE DONALD TRUMP WHO HAVE A RECKLESS APPROACH TO THIS IS PUTTING A ON THE GROUND. THAT IS NOT THE RIGHT APPROACH WORSE. STACEY: MR. SHERZAN, BEYOND ISIS, WHAT OTHER COUNTRY OR GROUP OF COUNTRIES POSES THE GREATEST THREAT TO U.S. SECURITY AND WHAT SPECIFIC ACTIONS WOULD YOU ENDORSE TO ADDRESS IT? MR. SHERZA THERE'S NO QUESTION THREAT. I DON'T THINK THERE'S A MONTH THAT GOES BY WHERE WE DON'T GET THREATENED BY THEM. I THINK UNDRESSING THAT THREAT, PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT BALLISTIC MISSILES, NUCLEAR WEAPONS THAT THEY ARE CLAIMING THEY WOULD USE AGAINST US, IS A SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. I SUPPORT WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS DOING, HOLDING BACK THAT EFFORT. WE HAVE TO SUPPORT OUR ALLIES IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD. I THINK WE ARE DOING THAT. IMPORTANT ASPECT IN THE GREATEST THREAT WE HAD. MOWRER? MR. MOWRER GLOBALLY AND STRATEGICALLY, THE COMPLEX THREATS THAT WE FACE, CHINA BOTH AS AN ECONOMIC TRADE PARTNER, DOING IN SUPPORT OF CYBER ATTACKS, STEALING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, STEALING SECRETS FROM OUR INTELLIGEN COMMUNITY, AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING IN THE NAVAL DOMAIN, CHINA VERY CLEARLY IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE FRONT IS PUSHING BACK AGAINST AMERICAN INFLUENCE THROUGHOUT THE GLOBE LARGEST THREAT. STACEY: MR. ADAMS, BEYOND ISIS WHAT IS ENEMY NUMBER ONE? MR. ADAMS: BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT, NOT BEING A MILITARY MAN MYSELF, BUT FROM WHAT I READ AND UNDERSTAND AND WHAT I'VE BEEN ADVISED ON, NORTH KOREA. ON HOW THEY HANDLE THEIR BUSINESS AND WHAT THEY DO FROM AN INTELLECTUAL PATENT PERSPECTIVE ON HOW THEY ATTACK OUR BUSINESSES, BUT CHINA IS BORDERED BY 13 OTHER COUNTRIES. NORTH KOREA, THEY TEND TO FASHION. STATE. WITH THEIR RECENT ACTIVITIES OF SHOOTING WARHEAD MISSILES INTO THE OCEAN, EVEN WHERE CHINA HAD TO STEP IN AND SAY YOU NEED TO SLOW DOWN, I THINK REALLY DEMONSTRATES THAT NOT ONLY ARE THEY PREPARING, BUT THEY HAVE REALLY BE CAREFUL FOR. TOPICS NOW. EVERY DAY NEARLY 300 AMERICANS AND ALMOST 90 DIED. STOPPING THE VIOLENCE WITHOUT STEPPING ON 2ND AMENDMENT WE BEGIN WITH MR. MOWRER. MR. MOWRER: YOU LOOK AT THE IN PLACE TO DO THIS. BACKGROUND CHECKS IS NUMBER ONE. EVERY SINGLE PURCHASE OF A FIREARM SHOULD UNDERGO A BACKGROUND CHECK AND WE NEED TO FOR THAT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT MENTAL HEALTH THE FUNDING WE ARE PUTTING THEIR, IT IS NOT ENOUGH. THESE ARE THE FIRST STEPS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN TO ADDRESS THIS. WE HAVE CULTURE, A RURAL CULTURE, PEOPLE WHO HAVE FIREARMS FOR HOME PROTECTION, HUNTING, OTHER LAWFU PURPOSES, RIGHTS. THAT SAID, THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE UNACCEPTABLE. WE HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED TO PUT PROBLEM. STACEY: MR. ADAMS, HOW DO YOU STOP THE VIOLENCE WITHOUT AMENDMENT RIGHTS? MR. ADAMS: WHEN DO WE GET TO A THEIR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IS ENOUGH? SHOCKED BY THAT. NOW IT BECOMES, HOW MANY KIDS HAVE? WE HAVE TO ROLL THAT THROW PROCESS -- THOUGHT PROCESS BACK. BACKGROUND CHECKS. I'M IN FAVOR OF CLOSING THE GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE. BUT I HAVE YET TO MEET A SELF-RESPECTING HUNTER THAT ORDER TO DO DEER HUNTING. I HAVE YET TO ME THAT INDIVIDUAL INDIVIDUAL. I DON'T BELIEVE WE NEED MILITARY WEAPONS TO DO HUNTING. BAD INTEREST. IT DOESN'T HELP US AND DOESN'T PROSPERITY. OUR COUNTRY. PEOPLE WHO WANT TO HUNT, LEGALLY, TO OWN A FIREARM FOR SOMETHING I SUPPORT. BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE GUN MISUNDERSTOOD. LICENSING. IF YOU ARE A GUN OWNER, YOU ARE THAT REQUIRES YOU TO DO A BACKGROUND CHECK. IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE IN A GUN SHOW AND DO A PRIVATE SALE, THAT RESPONSIBILITY DOES NOT EXIST. BE ADDRESSED. THOSE PEOPLE SELLI GUNS AT TO DO THAT. THE OTHER THING IS, I'M VERY MUCH IN FAVO OF LOOKING AT THE ASSAULT WEAPONS, BECAUSE I TOTALLY AGREE THAT ASSAULT WEAPONS AREN'T SOMETHING THAT I THINK THE AVERAGE HUNTER REALLY WANTS TO UTILIZE. WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT 15 CLIPS, 3 CLIPS THESE ARE NEED. STACEY: MR. ADAMS, DOES THE 2ND PERSONAL OWNERSHIP? OR IS THAT FOR ARMING MILITIA? MR. ADAMS: IT SAYS, A WELL-REGULATED MILITIA. I DON'T THINK THERE'S A CONCERN OF TAKING THE GUNS AWAY. ABOUT. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS HAVING GUNS THAT CAN DECIMATE ENTIRE BODIES OF PEOPLE IN A VERY SHORT ORDER AND HOW DOES THAT TIE TO HUNTING A DEER OR WILDERNESS? IT DOESN'T. THIS BECOMES AN ISSUE OF PEOPLE USING SCARE TACTICS TO SAY, THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE OUR GUNS. YOUR GUNS. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE FACT THAT WE'VE HAD TOO MANY INCIDENTS WHERE INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN DECIMATED, WHETHER BE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, MOVIE NATURE NOW. ADDRESS THAT. STACEY: MR. SHERZAN. THE QUESTION, PLEASE? STACEY: DOES THE 2ND AMENDMENT CREATE THE RIGHT FOR PERSONAL OWNERSHIP? OR IS THAT FOR ARMING MILITIA? MR. SHERZAN: THE LAST TIME I REVIEWED THE SECOND AMENDMENT, I THINK IT PROBABLY COVERED BOTH. PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO OWN A GUN IN THI COUNTRY, TO DO IT LEGALLY. HUNTING. THAT IS WHAT IT IS THERE FOR. THAT IS WHY THE EARLY AMERICANS DECIDED THAT IT WAS A RIGHT THAT THEY HAD, FOR PROTECTION. THAT IS THE WAY IT SHOULD BE. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS PREVENTING PEOPLE, MENTALLY ILL WEAPONS. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS OCCURRING AGAIN. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SUICIDES BECAUSE GUNS IN THE FAMILY ARE INTENDED TO. NOT ONLY DO I BELIEVE IN THE SECOND AMENDMENT, I BELIEVE ALSO THAT OUR CITIZENS WILL BE OWNERSHIP. STACEY: MR. MOWRER, SECOND OWNERSHIP RIGHTS? MR. MOWRER: I THINK IT GUARANTEES PERSONAL OWNERSHIP FOR LAWFUL AND LAW-ABIDING PURCHASE. THAT BEING SAID, WHEN I W THE MILITARY, I HAD TO UNDERGO A TRAINING REQUIREMENT. I HAVE SEEN FIRSTHAND THE WEAPONS HAVE. THEY DO NOT BELONG IN THE HANDS UNITED STATES. DAVI YOUNG, IN 2014, THE NRA SPENT MO MONEY SUPPORTING HIS ELECTION THAN ON ANY OTHER HOUSE CANDIDATE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE ARE NOT GOING TO SEE ANY MEANINGFUL REFORM OUT OF HIM. STACEY: THANK YOU. WE WILL TAKE ANOTHER BREAK NOW. UP NEXT, MORE OF YOUR VIEWER QUESTION STACEY: WELCOME BACK TO OUR DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY DEBATE WITH CANDIDATES FOR IOWA'S 3RD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT. WE'RE JOINED ONCE AGAIN BY KCCI'S CHIEF POLITICAL REPORTER CYNTHIA FODOR. CYNTHIA: HERE'S A QUESTION RIGHT NOW FROM CHERYL FRARACCI, WHAT SPECIFIC STEPS WOULD NEED TO BE TAKEN TO FIX THE NATIONAL DEBT? HOW WOULD YOU MAKE THAT HAPPEN YOU. MR. SHERZAN: IT IS INTERESTING. THERE HAS BEEN FOR A LONG TIME THE FOCUS ON THE NATIONAL DEBT AND REALLY WHAT THE FOCUS SHOULD THE DEFICIT. IF YOU UNDERSTAND BUDGETS, YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT OUR ECONOMIC SITUATION HASN'T BEEN IMPROVING FOR THE LAST -- HAS YEARS. 10 YEARS AGO, THE DEFICIT EQUALED ABOUT 10% OF OUR GDP. RECENTLY, IT REPRESENTED ABOUT 3%. ALL YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IS THE EMPLOYEES THAT ARE WORKING, THE NUMBER OF LABOR WORKERS WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY IMPROVING, SO REDUCING THE DEBT, ALTHOUGH IT THE FOCUS. DEFICIT. ULTIMATELY, IF YOU HAVE AN ECONOMY WHERE YOU GIVE GOOD WAGES, YOU INCREASE THE MINIMUM WAGE, YOU HAVE BUSINESS HAPPEN. THAT IS WHAT THEY DID IN THE 1990'S WHEN PRESIDENT CLINTON IMPLEMENTED HIS CHANGES. STACEY: CYNTHIA: DO YOU HAVE SPECIFIC IDEAS ON HOW TO REDUCE DEFICIT? ABOUT THE INTEREST PAYMENTS ON DEBT, ABOUT 6% OF OUR BUDGET. THE WRONG THINGS. WE'RE LOOKING AT THINGS THAT WE PERCEIVE -- NO QUESTION IT IS A PROBLEM AND IT THREATENS THIS COUNTRY IN THE LONG TERM, BUT BUDGETS ARE SIMPLY PRIORITIES. MY PRIORITIES ARE ON THINGS THAT AFFECT INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES, THEIR INCOME LEVELS, MINIMUM WAGE, EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN, DEBT, THOUGH IT IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE, IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE. CYNTHIA: MR. MOWRER. MR. MOWRER: AFTER WORLD WAR II, FIGHTING THE WAR. THE WAY WE GOT OUT OF THAT WAS WITH MASSIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH. THAT IS HOW WE ADDRESS OUR DEFICIT. THE LAST TIME WE HAD A BALANCED BUDGET IN THE 1990'S UNDER PRESIDENT CLINTON WAS BECAUSE WE WITH SMART GOVERNMENT. I BELIEVE IN INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE, CREATING GOOD JOBS THAT PAY TAX REVENUE. WE ALSO NEED TO END ALL THESE TAX BREAKS THAT THE OIL COMPANIES HAVE, THE SUBSIDIES, OIL COMPANIES AND WALL STREET. WE NEED TO PUT THE RULE IN PLACE THAT WOULD TAX INCOME OVER $1 INCOME. I THINK THAT IS INCOME. CYNTHIA: MR. ADAMS. HERE. FIRST, HOW ABOUT WE HAVE OUR MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES SUPPOSED TO PAY. SECONDARILY, LET'S TALK ABOUT GETTING THE MONEY FOR BACK INTO OUR COUNTRY. OVERSEAS. HOW ABOUT WE BRING THAT BACK AND HAVE FOLKS PAY TAXES ON THAT? LET'S TALK ABOUT NOT ONLY INCREASING OUR WAGES, WHICH I BELIEVE THE MORE MONEY FOLKS MAKE, THE MORE TAXES COME OUT OF THAT, BUT I THINK THERE'S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAX THE REALLY RISKY SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'VE SEEN WALL STREET DO. THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE WERE IN THE SITUATION WE WERE IN IN 2008. WE HAVE TO DO BETTER ON HOLDING HOLDING MILLIONAIRES AND COUNTRY. BEEN DOING. CYNTHIA: SINCE THE PERSON ELECTED WILL BE DEALING WITH FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES, WE HAVE A QUESTION FROM CHRISTINE ANDERS OF THE FIRST UNITED METHODIST CHURCH, SHE BELIEVES INTERNATIONAL LAW PROHIBITS THE OCCUPATION OF PALESTINIAN LAND BY ISRAEL. WHAT IS YOUR STAND ON THE CONTINUED BUILDING OF ISRAELI SETTLEMENTS? MOWRER. MR. MOWRER: I SPENT YEARS ON THE GROUND IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND I FACES. HAVING ALLY IN THE REGION IS IMPORTANT. SOLUTION. I ALSO BELIEVE IN ENSURING THAT ISRAEL IS SAFE AND WE INVEST IN THE IRON DOME AND CONTINUED ECONOMIC COOPERATION. CYNTHIA: MR. ADAMS? ISRAEL. I'M A STRONG SUPPORTER OF ISRAEL. SOLUTION. I BELIEVE THIS IS A CHALLENGE THAT HAS PREDATED US. THIS IS SOMETHING WE DO HAVE TO WE ARE GETTING CLOSER. STARTING TO SEE MORE MOVEMENT IN THAT SPACE. I WOULD LIKE TO GET TO A POINT WHERE FOLKS ARE NOT TRYING TO BLOW EACH OTHER UP TO EMPHASIZE THEIR POINT. CYNTHIA: MR. SHERZAN. MR. SHERZAN: THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT ISRAEL HAS BEEN AN ALLY OF OURS FOR MANY YEARS. I WILL SUPPORT THAT. YOU COULD MAKE AN ARGUMENT THAT IT IS A HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE. THE PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS YEARS. WE ALL WANT TO SEE THAT STOP. BUT WE ALSO WANT TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF THE ISRAELIS TO SURVIVE. BUT WE HAVE TO ALSO CONSIDER THE TURMOIL THAT GOES ON, THE CONSTANT WAR THAT GOES ON. -- I'M I ALSO THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEACEMAKING, LIKE WE SAW 20 YEARS AGO WITH THE AGREEMENTS. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS, THAT WAR WILL CONTINUE UNTIL WE CAN GET THE TWO PARTIES SPEAKING AGAIN. STACEY: THANK YOU. NOW. THE NATION'S LARGEST HEALTHCARE INSURER IS PULLING OUT OF TWO STATE OBAMACARE MARKETS AND WELLMARK JUST NOTIFIED 30,000 CUSTOMERS IT PLANS RAISE THEIR PREMIUMS.

Supporters clash with protesters; George W Bush condemns fellow Republican for Mexican heritage bias against judge in Trump University fraud case

Fallout from Donald Trump’s incendiary comments about Gonzalo Curiel has continued to rain down on the campaign trail today, with the candidate doubling, then tripling down on his declaration that the Latino federal judge should recuse himself from presiding over the multi-state fraud suit against Trump University because his heritage presents a “conflict of interest.”That’s it for news from the campaign trail - stay tuned for more up-to-the-second coverage from around the country!

In an interview with ABC, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton criticized Donald Trump’s call for the recusal of the federal judge overseeing the multi-state fraud suit against Trump University because of his Mexican heritage, citing Trump’s own German heritage as an example.“If our president doesn’t believe in the rule of the law, doesn’t believe in our constitution with a separation of power with an independent judiciary, that is one of the most dangerous signals that we are dealing with somebody who is a demagogue who would rip up our most valued beliefs,” Clinton told Elex Michaelson.“It makes no sense to me. The judge was born in Indiana. Yes, he’s of Mexican heritage. Donald Trump is apparently of German heritage. What does that mean? We are all Americans.”“He would try to disqualify any woman who is a judge because he has said terrible things about women,” Clinton said. “Any Muslim American who’s a judge anywhere. If we start disqualifying people because of who their parents and grandparents might be and where they came from, that would be running counter to everything we believe in.”Updated

After a cataclysmic interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper previewed this afternoon, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump ripped into likely opponent Hillary Clinton at a rally in Redding, California, telling the audience that “this country is going to die” if she is elected in November. “Hillary Clinton is a weak person,” Trump said. “Hillary Clinton is totally scripted. Hillary Clinton is a thief. And Hillary Clinton should be in jail for what she did to our national security.”“If you choose Hillary Clinton, this country is going to die.”The real estate tycoon also criticized Clinton for her use of a teleprompter to deliver an aggressive foreign policy speech yesterday that called his ideas “dangerously incoherent.”“I don’t have teleprompters; I don’t need teleprompters,” Trump said, pointing to his temple. “It’s called up here, it’s called memory, it’s called other things.”“A lot of people didn’t know that - she was reading a script,” he continued. “She’d read a line, and then she had the phony audience. If I ever did that, I’d be run out of town, but for Hillary, it’s OK.”

In an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump denied that he is a racist and continued to bore into an American-born judge of Mexican descent who is presiding over the multi-state fraud case against Trump University.“I think he should recuse himself,” Trump said.Tapper asked Trump if his insistence that Gonzalo Curiel should step aside because his Latino heritage presents a “conflict of interest” is “the definition of racism,” Trump shrugged, apparently misunderstanding the question. “No. I don’t think so at all - he’s proud of his heritage, I respect him for that.”The CNN anchor rephrased the question, pointing out that Trump’s insistence that a Latino judge could not rule fairly in a case against him is predicated entirely on the judge’s race.“Look,” Trump said. “He’s proud of his heritage. I’m building a wall. Now, I think I’m doing very well...”Tapper attempted to point out that Curiel was born in Indiana, but Trump continued.“I’m going to do very well with Hispanics because I’m going to bring back jobs and they’re going to get jobs right now,” Trump said. “I think I’m going to do very well with Hispanics, but we’re building a wall. He’s a Mexican. We’re building a wall between here and Mexico. The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings - rulings that people can’t even believe. This case should have ended years ago. The best lawyers - I have spoken to so many lawyers. They said this is not a case. this is a case that should have ended. This judge is giving us unfair rulings. Now I say, why? Well, I’m building a wall, okay? And it’s a wall between Mexico, not another country.”“But he’s not from Mexico,” Tapper said. “He’s from Indiana.”Trump was not swayed. “Mexican heritage. And he’s very proud of it.”Updated

Likely Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has built a double-digit polling lead over presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, according to the results of a new Reuters/Ipsos poll released this afternoon, recovering from a humiliating result last month in which the former secretary of state was tied with the political arriviste.According to the poll, 46% of likely voters told Reuters that they supported Clinton’s candidacy, while 35% said that they were supporting Trump. The remaining 19% told Reuters that they would not support either candidate.The survey of 1,421 likely voters was conducted between May 30 and June 3 - meaning that the numbers were likely influenced by the release of documents relating to the multi-state fraud suit against Trump University, as well as Trump’s declaration that the assignment of a federal judge of Mexican descent to the case represents “an absolute conflict” because he is “of Mexican heritage”.On May 12, the same poll showed Clinton leading Trump by a statistically insignificant one-tenth of one percentage point.

Ed PilkingtonFirst lady Michelle Obama has delivered a withering attack on Donald Trump, warning a graduating class of New York students, and through them America, that those who seek to rule by intimidation and fear end up diminishing the hope and freedom of their nations.Without mentioning the presumptive Republican presidential candidate by name, Obama made one of the most sustained and potent attacks on Trump since he began his bid for the White House last year. She portrayed his brand of politics as un-American and dangerous, comparing him to world leaders “who stifle the voices and dismiss the potential of their citizens … who demonise and dehumanise entire groups of people because they have nothing else to offer.”Addressing the class of 2016 at the City College of New York in her 23rd and final commencement speech as first lady, she said: “Graduates that is not who we are. That is not what this country stands for.”She went on: “Here in America we don’t let our differences tear us apart. Here in America we don’t give into our fears, we don’t build walls to keep people out.” Related: Michelle Obama: 'In America we don't build walls to keep people out'

Mona ChalabiA new poll from the Los Angeles Times/USC Dornsife suggests that the pivotal state of California might be a tighter contest between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders than previously thought. A survey of 1,500 registered voters found that 44% of Democrats said they’d support Sanders and 43% said they’d support Clinton in the state’s primary which will be held next Tuesday.The results seem, at first glance, to be hugely significant. With 546 Democratic delegates available, California is the single most influential state this primary season. And, since Sanders needs 837 extra delegates to become the Democratic nominee, he’s going to need to count on Democratic Californians’ support. However, (and this will come as no surprise to anyone who has been observing voting processes in primaries so far), things are far more complicated than they first seem.First of all, Sanders doesn’t just need to win a large number of delegates - he needs to prevent Clinton from winning the small number of delegates that she needs to cross the finish line and become the Democratic nominee. Including superdelegates, Clinton is now only 70 delegates away from that victory. What that means in practice is that Sanders can’t just win by one percentage point, as the Los Angeles Times poll suggests he might - the Vermont senator needs to pick up around 90% of the vote in California and leave Clinton with just 10%. Since Democrats (unlike Republicans) distribute delegates more proportionally to vote share, that 10% would translate to around 55 delegates for Clinton.But that’s not all. Sanders would need similarly spectacular wins on Tuesday in Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota and South Dakota to keep Clinton from winning the nomination. If that weren’t bad enough, there’s good reason to think that the poll from the Los Angeles Times might be overstating Sanders’ share of the vote. Of the 1,500 registered voters they spoke to, 1,184 said that they were likely to vote. Since the poll was conducted so close to the primary (respondents were contacted from May 16 to 31) it’s those likely voters that are the ones to watch, and among them Sanders’ narrow lead vanishes; he commands just 39% compared to Clinton’s 49%.Finally, the election analyst’s mantra “it’s only one poll” is important here. Looking at the average of the 14 polls that have been conducted in California so far this year, Clinton consistently has a solid lead of between 5 and 11 percentage points. Next Tuesday’s primaries probably won’t change the names on the ballot in November - they’re still highly likely to be Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. But that doesn’t mean next week’s primaries are insignificant - understanding the demographics of those candidates’ support will be crucial to figuring out who is likely to become the president of the country.

Sam LevinBernie Sanders will not be skydiving into a California rally, as was briefly, but widely speculated this morning.Yet remarkably, it does seem that the Democratic presidential candidate’s campaign team explored the idea of parachuting the 74-year-old candidate into the event.The unlikely rumor was widely shared on social media after a story in the Press Democrat, a local paper in northern California, suggested the Vermont senator might skydive at an evening rally hosted by a skydiving company at the Cloverdale Municipal Airport, about 90 miles north of San Francisco.The campaign was swift to shoot down the rumor. “Ha I wouldn’t count on it,” Sanders spokeswoman Sarah Ford texted the Guardian when asked for confirmation.However, Jimmy Halliday, owner of NorCal Skydiving, whose remarks to the local paper kickstarted the speculation, insisted that the Sanders campaign team approached him directly about the idea of having the presidential candidate skydive in front of a crowd.“A lot of members of his team have said this would definitely be something he’s interested in,” he told the Guardian in a phone interview. “We’re ready. I would love to jump with Bernie.” Related: No, Bernie Sanders is not skydiving into a rally – but it seems it was discussed

Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell dodged a series of questions from MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell regarding Donald Trump’s sustained attacks on a federal judge presiding over the Trump University fraud case, telling Mitchell that the presumptive Republican nominee is “certainly a different kind of candidate.”.@SenateMajLdr McConnell says Trump’s attacks on New Mexico governor “don’t serve the candidate very well” https://t.co/gCb72wHDX1McConnell declined to condemn Trump’s comments or say that he thought the notion that a judge’s ethnicity should factor into their case assignment. “What I am willing to say,” McConnell said, “is that Donald Trump is certainly a different kind of candidate. You know, we had 17 people competing for the nomination Andrea and Donald Trump won the most primaries and caucuses.”McConnell, when pressed, said that he is “unfamiliar with this particular judge,” but did say that a similar attack on a fellow Republican was “unfortunate.”“I thought it completely unfortunate and unnecessary for our nominee to attack the governor of New Mexico, Susana Martinez, who I know well,” McConnell said. “I think these attacks don’t serve the candidate very well.”

Donald Trump is tripling down on his comments about the federal judge presiding over a fraud suit against one of his defunct companies, telling the New York Times that “I have a Mexican judge. He’s of Mexican heritage. He should have recused himself, not only for that, for other things.”Trump’s continued attacks against Gonzalo Curiel, the federal judge presiding over the Trump University fraud case, were highlighted last night when the presumptive Republican presidential nominee told the Wall Street Journal that Curiel’s assignment to the case represents “an absolute conflict” because he is “of Mexican heritage”.“I’m building a wall,” Trump said, of his proposed 2,000-mile barrier along the US-Mexico border. “It’s an inherent conflict of interest.”Trump is facing three class action lawsuits against Trump University over allegations of fraud. Trump denies all the charges and has vowed to fight them in court.The notion that judges cannot rule on cases involving religious, racial or other minorities of which they are members is universally discredited in the American legal system.Updated

The bloom is off the rose in House speaker Paul Ryan’s arranged political marriage to presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. After the candidate accused the federal judge presiding over a fraud suit against one of his defunct companies of bias because of his “Mexican heritage,” Ryan told a Wisconsin radio station that he “completely disagree[s]” with Trump on the matter.Ryan, who endorsed Trump less than 24 hours ago, told WISN’s Up Front with Vicki McKenna that “the comment about the judge the other day just was out of left field,” as reported by Buzzfeed News.“It’s reasoning I don’t relate to,” Ryan continued. “I completely disagree with the thinking behind that, and so, he clearly says and does things I don’t agree with, and I’ve had to speak up on time to time when that has occurred, and I’ll continue to do that if that’s necessary.”“I hope it’s not.”Trump stepped up his attack on Gonzalo Curiel, the federal judge presiding over the Trump University fraud case, last night when he told the Wall Street Journal that Curiel’s assignment to the case represents “an absolute conflict” because he is “of Mexican heritage”.“I’m building a wall,” Trump said, of his proposed 2,000-mile barrier along the US-Mexico border with the stated goal of preventing undocumented immigrants from entering the country. “It’s an inherent conflict of interest.”The presumptive Republican presidential nominee’s statements follow a speech in San Diego last week in which he lambasted Curiel as “a hater of Donald Trump” and “a total disgrace.”

Vermont senator Bernie Sanders won’t be skydiving to his rally in Cloverdale, California, today, a sure blow to the candidate’s support among the extreme sports demographic.Yesterday, a local paper had reported that Sanders’ campaign had discussed the possibility of dropping the 74-year-old senator out of a plane to enter his rally on Friday night, quoting the president of NorCal Skydiving as having said “I’ve been told they will run the idea by Bernie.”Today, unfortunately, Sanders’ team told the Daily Beast that Sanders will appear onstage after being ferried there by more terrestrial means.“The senator won’t be skydiving today,” wrote press secretary Symone Sanders (no relation). “Thanks!”

Former secretary of state Madeleine Albright rolled her eyes at continued scrutiny of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server during her tenure at the state department, telling CNN this morning that the controversy is over “a mistake.”“Nobody is going to die as a result of anything that happened on emails,” Albright said.Likely Clinton opponent Donald Trump, however, is a serious threat to American security, Albright continued.“He is erratic,” Albright said. “He says crazy things.

Hillary Clinton is so prone to prevarication that even torture couldn’t get her to tell the truth, according to one of Donald Trump’s top campaign advisers.Barry Bennett, who once served as Ben Carson’s campaign manager, remarked today that “You couldn’t get the truth from Hillary Clinton if you waterboarded her,” in reference to the presumptive Republican presidential nominee’s promise to prosecute Clinton over her use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state.“I mean, if this attorney general tries to block it, then, you know, special counsel should be appointed,” Bennett said. “I mean, it’s crazy! I mean, she has continued to lie about it, right? She told us the lawyers signed off on it - the inspector general said that’s not true. She said she would cooperate with all of the investigations, she stonewalled... and now everybody taking the Fifth.”That’s when Bennett made the waterboarding reference, which seemed to shock the usually unflappable Bolduan.“What?” she exclaimed, and Bennett repeated himself.At a Republican debate in Manchester, New Hampshire, in February, the candidate said that he would “bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding”, or simulated drowning, if he were elected president.

donald trump's foreign policy team: one "very good brain" with very thin skin.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-silva/clinton-vs-trump-the-real_b_10279992.html

(Updated at 10:20 pm EDT, 6/3/16)What an insulting campaign we have on our screens.

An impenetrable cloud of character assault, aspersions, invectives and innuendo -- not to mention a Twitter crossfire fit for a schoolyard -- hangs today over a presidential election just five months away. The morning-after reviews of Hillary Clinton's frontal assault on Donald Trump depict the delivery of her diatribe as "lacerating, mauling, stinging, blistering'' and "withering'' -- an "evisceration.'' He called it simply "pathetic."

And a tirade of tweets that started before her speech was even finished continues today, with Trump tweeting: "In Crooked Hillary's teleprompter speech yesterday, she made up things that I said or believe but have no basis in fact. Not honest!" No details here, of course, in a message apparently confirming the web-video Clinton is airing at her own account today, tweeting: "Donald Trump's foreign policy team: one 'very good brain' with very thin skin.''It may take some time to assess the fallout of all this radioactive rhetoric on a contest in which the two presumptive nominees of the nation's leading political parties are perceived more unfavorably than any front-runners in either party since 1984, when CBS News starting surveying voters on this question. A solid majority of voters hold a dim view of both Clinton and Trump, and it's difficult to see how the debate underway will improve that.

The candidates' words are calculated for their immediate effect on the instant cable news cycle, yet one searing day of vilification will not settle a match in which the average of the most recent public opinion polls portrays a dead heat between the two. We are in for a months-long pummelling of audible-call artillery from both camps, a punishing volley of direct hits.At his own rally in San Jose, Trump dismissed Clinton's assault as a "sad... political speech" and characterized the candidate as a puppet of teleprompter President Barack Obama. "Yes, sir, Mr. President, sir. What would you like? What would you like me to say, sir?"' mocked Trump, in a parroting of Clinton's relationship with the White House which he attributed to Clinton's fear of indictment over her private email account as secretary of state. "Because you know why? She doesn't want to go to jail. That's why."In an interview with The New York Times during Clinton's speech, Trump called Clinton's performance "terrible" and "pathetic." He added: "I'm not thin-skinned at all. I'm the opposite of thin-skinned."Update: Trump retaliated later today with an assessment as blistering as Clinton's: "Frankly, I honestly believe -- and I really mean this -- I think that Hillary Clinton is unfit to lead our country, certainly at this time," Trump told an audience. "I think she's unfit. She doesn't have what it takes.""I really believe I have the greatest temperament there is and the temperament that this country needs at this time,'' Trump said. "Look, let me tell you, I have a tough temperament, but we need a tough temperament. Now my temperament is totally controlled, so beautiful."Clinton, he contended, is "greedy -- -- she's greedy as hell -- and that's, I think, the reason she wants it," Trump said. "But she doesn't have the talent for the job. She's not a natural for the job."It's a question of leadership, both maintain, each insisting the other lacks what it takes to lead the most powerful nation on Earth."Americans aren't just electing a president in November,'' Clinton said. "We're choosing our next commander-in-chief -- the person we count on to decide questions of war and peace, life and death. And like many across our country and around the world, I believe the person the Republicans have nominated for president cannot do the job.''"Donald Trump's ideas aren't just different -- they are dangerously incoherent,'' Clinton said. "They're not even really ideas -- just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds, and outright lies. He is not just unprepared -- he is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility.''"This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes -- because it's not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.''Trump's reply in San Jose: "Hillary said, 'Oh, Donald Trump, his finger on the button.' I'm the one who didn't want to go in Iraq, folks." The essential message of Clinton's rebuke will be repeated day after day by the candidate and surrogates: Trump is downright dangerous. "We cannot put the security of our children and grandchildren in Donald Trump's hands. We cannot let him roll the dice with America.''"Making Donald Trump our commander-in-chief would be a historic mistake. And it would fuel an ugly narrative about who we are -- that we're fearful, not confident; that we want to let others determine our future for us, instead of shaping our own destiny.''

There were probably 15 individual speeches embedded in the template she coolly delivered yesterday. The Times says the speech was "roughly 10 days in the making,'' crafted by a sizable team of wordsmiths with late-draft advice from Obama's own former chief speechwriter.Yet from the start of his own upstart claim to the Republican nomination, Trump has displayed a debilitating ability to shoot first, landing wounding salvoes without the assistance of any consultants. He already has crafted his refrain: "Crooked Hillary." Mocking his penchant for attacking rivals on Twitter during her speech, Clinton said: "I'm willing to bet he's writing a few right now:" Trump was tweeting: "Bad performance by Crooked Hillary! Reading poorly from prompter! doesn't even look presidential!"The play on the teleprompter is reminiscent of the way Obama was mocked during his first campaign for president. This time, though, the opposition has demonstrated an uncanny talent for the impromptu remark that captures the cable chyron of the moment. 

It'll be telling to see who looks presidential when this nasty race is run -- whose pejoratives are more penetrating, and who actually turns out to vote."This isn't reality television -- this is actual reality,'' Clinton said yesterday, mocking Trump's credentials as the star of television's "The Apprentice'' and deriding his foreign policy credentials as the sponsor of a Miss Universe contest in Russia. "Now imagine Donald Trump sitting in the Situation Room, making life-or-death decisions on behalf of the United States,'' said Clinton, recounting her own experience at Obama's side in the Situation Room as he made the call on Osama bin Laden."Imagine (Trump) deciding whether to send your spouses or children into battle,'' she said. "Imagine if he had not just his Twitter account at his disposal when he's angry, but America's entire arsenal.''

 "I watched Hillary today, it was pathetic,'' Trump said from his own rally stage. "It was so sad to watch. She's up there, supposed to be a foreign policy speech. It was a political speech. It was pretty pathetic.''

"We are in a movement -- they've never seen anything like it... Some of these pundits have even said, almost all of them, that's there's never been anything like this that's ever happened in the United States, never been,'' Trump said. "We have a movement going on, we're on the cover of every newspaper, every magazine. Time magazine many times... I just learned they're doing yet another cover on Trump, I love that.''

recordatorio para mr. trump.

Presidente de Latino Victory ProjectUna victoria más para el alguacil sería una derrota para la comunidad inmigrante y latina.En junio se celebra el Mes de la Herencia del Inmigrante para celebrar la diversidad y la herencia que todos tenemos en común y que nos ha unido a través de la historia de este país. Como si fuera un banderazo de dicha celebración, un juez federal en Arizona anunció que se está contemplando una compensación monetaria para cientos de inmigrantes latinos que fueron víctimas de la discriminación racial del alguacil del condado de Maricopa, Joe Arpaio. Mientras que en este momento nuestro país es acechado por una ola destructiva de retórica anti-inmigrante y anti-latina, encabezada por el candidato presidencial Donald Trump, la decisión del juez federal es un recordatorio alentador de que ahora más que nunca los latinos podemos y debemos luchar por nuestros derechos civiles, tanto en la corte como en las casillas electorales.Hace unas semanas le llegó la hora a Joe Arpaio, quien ha dedicado gran parte de su carrera como oficial de la ley a humillar y deshumanizar a la comunidad inmigrante y latina en Arizona. Un juez federal declaró que Arpaio y tres de sus empleados y exempleados del departamento del alguacil del condado de Maricopa violaron a propósito una orden que prohibía la detención de latinos basada solo en el perfil racial. Ahora, además de la restitución monetaria, el juez federal está contemplando el castigo que se le dará a Arpaio por discriminar a cientos de latinos. La decision podría incluir cargos criminales por no seguir la orden de la corte.Esta noticia positiva que estamos viendo en medio de noticias de redadas y ataques racistas en contra de inmigrantes y de latinos se da gracias a que miembros de la comunidad latina, representados en la corte por la Unión Americana de Libertades Civiles (ACLU por sus siglas en inglés), MALDEF, ACLU-Arizona, entre otros, y apoyados por organizaciones latinas, decidieron alzar la voz y luchar en contra de la represión. Saben que tenemos el poder de actuar para que no pisoteen nuestras libertades civiles en nombre de una plataforma política anti-inmigrante.Personas como Joe Arpaio propagan ideas regresivas que están basadas en el miedo y el odio irracional a personas que no son de su misma raza. Estas ideas son como un cáncer que puede desparramarse y causar un daño irreversible al país si no se detienen a tiempo. El daño que promueven estas ideas racistas —que pueden convertirse en leyes que definen nuestras vidas cotidianas— no solo afecta a los inmigrantes indocumentados sino a cada uno de nosotros, sin importar nuestra raza o estatus migratorio. Cuando una persona es arrestada y entregada a las autoridades por el simple hecho de tener un tipo de color de piel o de aspecto físico, los principios de tolerancia y de libertad que se promueven como estandartes de los Estados Unidos se suspenden, y en su lugar se introduce el espectro de la intolerancia y la represión. Bajo dichas leyes, todos estamos en peligro.Cabe recordar que Arpaio, quien estará en la boleta electoral en noviembre para alguacil del condado de Maricopa, utiliza su postura anti-inmigrante como parte de su plataforma política. Una victoria más para Arpaio sería una derrota para la comunidad inmigrante y latina. Los residentes del condado de Maricopa pueden truncar la trayectoria racista de Arpaio saliendo a votar en noviembre. Así como tenemos el poder de sacar a Arpaio de su cargo público, igual debemos de unirnos en contra de Trump y de cualquiera que intente quitarnos la calidad de vida digna que todo ser humano merece y de quien intente teñir de lodo la cultura de diversidad que tanto ha beneficiado el tejido social y económico de nuestro país. No debemos permitir que décadas de esfuerzo y progreso en este país de inmigrantes se deshagan en manos de mentes estrechas que carecen de visión y no ven más allá de muros imaginarios que les ciegan la vía hacia el progreso humano.Nota: La presente pieza fue seleccionada para publicación en nuestra sección de opinión como una contribución al debate público.

To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQsSubscribed, but don't have a login?Illustration of a lifebuoy adrift in the ocean surrounded by hungry sharks(Photo: Paul Fleet, Getty Images/iStockphoto)Payday lenders gouge the poor. They offer "cash advances” or “check loans" due for repayment on a customer’s next payday. Some charge interest rates as high as 360 percent and employ deceptive and illegal practices to take advantage of consumers who are already financially distressed, according to the Federal Trade Commission. While the lenders' bricks-and-mortar establishments are frequently located near low-income neighborhoods and college campuses, they have proliferated online. Anyone can find them with the click of a mouse.So no one with a conscience was disappointed when Google announced in May that it would ban advertisements for payday loans and related products from its system. The company, which operates the most-used Internet search engine in the world, imposed a strict standard for its ban: loans for which repayment is due within 60 days and those carrying annual interest rates of 36 percent or higher.The payday lending industry wasn't too pleased, however, calling the move "discriminatory and a form of censorship."Of course, Google is a private company. It can refuse ads for any product or service it chooses and already bans them for firearms and tobacco. It is also performing a public service if it can make it more difficult for consumers to connect with these lenders. Meanwhile, government attempts to rein them in are frequently unsuccessful or nonexistent. Iowa’s elected officials are especially disappointing.“The payday loan business model makes extraordinary profits by locking people into a cycle of debt,” said Sen. Joe Bolkcom, D-Iowa City. He has repeatedly introduced legislation intended to protect consumers, but his efforts got nowhere due to a lack of support from other lawmakers. “Every single loan is a rip-off. Borrowers are generally low-wage earners living paycheck to paycheck. In Iowa they would be better off getting loans from loan sharks. They would find better terms from loan sharks," he said.Unfortunately, the payday lending industry is finding plenty of customers in Iowa. Fifty different entities hold state licenses for 173 locations offering “delayed deposit services,” better known as payday lending. In 2014, they issued more than 760,000 short-term loans valued at nearly $280 million, according to information the editorial board obtained from the Iowa Division of Banking. The average customer had approximately 12 loans with the same lender that year, though many customers have loans with more than one lender. These individuals borrowed an average of $340 at an annual percentage rate of nearly 260 percent.Though the industry argues it is helping people facing a financial emergency, the loans are frequently taken out to repay previous loans. Borrowing for a one-time expense can set in motion a lengthy cycle of borrowing that results in owing hundreds or thousands more than someone originally needed.Even when people repay the loan, just doing business with these lenders may come back to haunt them. The FTC is warning consumers about scammers who attempt to collect fake "phantom" debt that consumers do not owe. They know just enough about their targets to convince them they still owe money, and who is going to remember the details of a loan taken out a few years ago? The scammers hound family members of the borrower and want them to pay the phantom debt with a credit card.So Iowa's lack of action to limit payday lenders is disgraceful. And it's a national embarrassment. A 2014 study from The Pew Charitable Trusts found 15 states have no payday loan storefronts, thanks to restrictions imposed by state officials. Nine more have imposed at least some limitations, including lower payments on fees or longer repayment periods. Then there’s Iowa. It was listed among the states considered “permissive,” defined as the least regulated and allowing annual percentage rates of as much as 521 percent.Meanwhile, the federal government is struggling to thwart financial predators. President Barack Obama has made no secret of his disgust at their practices. A $500 loan payday loan ends up costing people $1,000 in interest and fees, he said during a 2015 speech on consumer protections in Alabama. He also told the audience there were four times more payday lenders in that state than McDonald’s restaurants.“We don’t mind people making a profit,” Obama said. “But if you’re making that profit by trapping hard-working Americans into a vicious cycle of debt, you gotta find a new business model.”Under his direction, the FTC has filed numerous law enforcement and legal actions against payday lenders. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is working on regulations expected to limit how and when lenders can gain access to money in consumers’ bank accounts. Consumer advocates are hopeful the CFPB can make a difference, as lenders have often adapted and survived in response to state regulations. They tweak loan conditions, change their licensing status, and even set up on Native American reservations which are exempt from state regulations.While government should continue to try to limit and pursue bad actors, credit unions and banks should do more to provide emergency loans to low-income consumers. These frequently include their own customers. And the impact of Google's power in limiting the reach of payday lenders cannot be underestimated.Ideally, however, the goal should be creating a country where payday lenders fold up shop because they have no customers. A good first step would be ensuring workers are paid a living wage, so they can cover basic costs of living and hopefully build a nest egg for emergencies. It means better financial education and consumer awareness. There is something seriously wrong in this country when an industry that bleeds money from poor Americans can thrive.Abusive payday lending is sinfulSenior members of the Obama administration met with religious leaders from around the country in April to talk about consumer protections and specifically payday lenders. They shared stories of Americans whose lives have been devastated by usurious loans. “What emerged was a common, powerful theme: that we have a moral obligation as a country to do something to stop payday lenders from preying on consumers by trapping them in an endless cycle of debt,” according to the White House.A recent survey reported 77 percent of Christians and 85 percent of Evangelical Christians think predatory lending is sinful. More than 90 percent of Christians believe lenders should only extend loans at reasonable rates and based on the ability of a borrower to repay.
